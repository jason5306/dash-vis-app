However, few samples, complex composition, and diverse Thangka images give the present methods a challenge for Thangka Yidam classification. To this end, we propose an improved method for Thangka Yidam classification based on DenseNet and SENet, which improves the transmission and reuse of feature information. First, a weighted pooling function is designed in the squeeze operation of SENet to alleviate the loss of feature information. Second, we further embed the improved SENet between dense blocks and transition layers of DenseNet to learn the weight correlation between feature channels. Finally, we adopt the Leaky ReLU function to optimize the network in DenseNet. The experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of our method on the constructed Thangka dataset is increased by 5.54% to 95.89% compared with DenseNet model, and the accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset is increased by 2.23% to 92.46%. Moreover, the experiments on Thangka dataset also show the significant improvements of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods, which proves the generalization ability of our method.","[Xue, Panpan; Hu, Wenjin; Yue, Chaoyang; Tang, Huiyuan; Song, Huafei; He, Guoyuan] Northwest Minzu Univ, Key Lab Chinas Ethn Languages & Informat Technol, Minist Educ, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Xue, Panpan; Hu, Wenjin] Northwest Minzu Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Yue, Chaoyang; Tang, Huiyuan; Song, Huafei; He, Guoyuan] Northwest Minzu Univ, Natl Languages Informat Technol, Lanzhou, Peoples R China",,"Xue, PP (通讯作者)，Northwest Minzu Univ, Key Lab Chinas Ethn Languages & Informat Technol, Minist Educ, Lanzhou, Peoples R China.;Xue, PP (通讯作者)，Northwest Minzu Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Lanzhou, Peoples R China.",72505830@qq.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [62061042, 61862057]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [31920200066]; Program for Innovative Research Team of SEAC [2018[98]]; Northwest Minzu University Graduate Research Innovation Project [Yxm2021069]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Program for Innovative Research Team of SEAC; Northwest Minzu University Graduate Research Innovation Project,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 62061042 and 61862057, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant No. 31920200066, the Program for Innovative Research Team of SEAC [2018[98]], and the Northwest Minzu University Graduate Research Innovation Project No. Yxm2021069.",,24,0,0,1,1,SPIE-SOC PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98225 USA",1017-9909,1560-229X,,J ELECTRON IMAGING,J.

Due to the fierce gathering, jumping, chasing and other actions that occur during fish school feeding, images contain varying degrees of noise and significant overlap between fish targets. Therefore, accurately identifying fish school feeding behavior be-comes challenging. To address this problem, the study proposes a MobileNetV2-SENet-based method for iden-tifying fish school feeding behavior. To enhance sample diversity, fish school images are preprocessed with some operations, such as random cropping and brightness-contrast adjustment. Then, MobileNetV2 is used to extract fish school image features, and a feature weighting network based on SENet (Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks) is built. Weights are assigned to features with varying degrees of value. The feeding behavior of fish school is identified using the linear classifier. Finally, a method of determining feeding amount is provided based on the identification result to reduce feed consumption. The SENet is introduced in the proposed method based on the original MobileNetV2 feature extraction network, and a feature extraction and weighting network that integrates MobileNetV2 and SENet is built to improve the weights of features relevant for fish school state identification while suppressing the weights of interference elements such as noise, resulting in more accurate identification. The proposed method was tested on the real fish school images and yielded an accuracy of 97.76%. The accuracy of our model was improved by 3.81%, 9.99%, 50.35%, and 100.37% when compared to the fish school feeding behavior identification model based on EfficientNet_B0, ShuffleNetV2, AlexNet, and EfficientNetV2, respectively, indicating that our method can accurately identify the feeding behavior of fish school in real aquaculture.","[Zhang, Lu; Li, Beibei; Liu, Yiran; Zhang, Hongxu; Duan, Qingling] China Agr Univ, Coll Informat & Elect Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lu; Li, Beibei; Liu, Yiran; Zhang, Hongxu; Duan, Qingling] China Agr Univ, Natl Innovat Ctr Digital Fishery, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lu; Li, Beibei; Liu, Yiran; Zhang, Hongxu; Duan, Qingling] China Agr Univ, Beijing Engn & Technol Res Ctr Internet Things Agr, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jianping] Ningbo Inst Oceanog & Fisheries, Ningbo 315000, Peoples R China",,"Duan, QL (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Informat & Elect Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",dqling@cau.edu.cn,,,Ningbo Public Welfare Science and Technology Project [202002N3034]; Ningbo Science and Technol-ogy Plan Project [2021S027]; Shandong Province Major Scien-tific and Technological Innovation Project [2019JZZY010703],Ningbo Public Welfare Science and Technology Project; Ningbo Science and Technol-ogy Plan Project; Shandong Province Major Scien-tific and Technological Innovation Project,"Acknowledgments This study was supported by the Ningbo Public Welfare Science and Technology Project (202002N3034) , the Ningbo Science and Technol-ogy Plan Project (2021S027) , and the Shandong Province Major Scien-tific and Technological Innovation Project (2019JZZY010703) .",,39,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-8609,1873-5614,,AQUACULT ENG,Aquac.

Therefore, it is necessary to use an accurate short-term load forecasting method for power grid dispatching and planning. Taking the onshore wind power load data of Valencia, Spain (from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018), as the research object, this paper proposes a hybrid model of bidirectional gated recurrent units and squeeze-and-excitation networks (BiGRU-SENet) based on an attention mechanism, which is good at handling the nonlinearity of high-dimensional time series data, to predict short-term power loads. The results showed that (1) the attention mechanism could significantly improve the predictive performance of BiGRU by weighting the input of different time steps. (2) The GRU-CNN was more suitable for short-term load forecasting than CNN-GRU, which could make full use of time series information and not lose the key information at the beginning. (3) SENet enabled CNN to perform feature-wise recalibration, further focusing on effective features. (4) Compared with the second-best model (BiGRU-Attention-CNN), BiGRU-Attention-SENet was 12.849% and 3.096% lower in terms of the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE), respectively. In terms of computational overheads, BiGRU-Attention-SENet achieved greater improvement in prediction accuracy by adding relatively fewer computational overheads (the parameters increased by 0.338%, and the FLOPs increased by 0.621%). (5) Through fine tuning, the pre-trained model achieved almost the same accuracy as the no pre-trained one in a shorter time, which proved that BiGRU-Attention-SENet had strong generalization ability. The hybrid model proposed in this paper has application prospects in power load forecasting.","[Xu, Yucheng; Jiang, Xuchu] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Stat & Math, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, XC (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Stat & Math, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xuchujiang@zuel.edu.cn,,,,,,,20,0,0,42,45,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1556-7036,1556-7230,,ENERG SOURCE PART A,Energy Sources Part A-Recovery Util.

Traditional methods based on handcrafted feature extraction and image processing often face this dilemma when confronting high-resolution remote sensing images for their complicated texture and intensity distribution. In this letter, we apply the prevalent deep convolutional neural networks to the sea-land segmentation problem and make two innovations on top of the traditional structure. First, we propose a local smooth regularization to achieve better spatially consistent results, which frees us from the complicated morphological operations that are commonly used in traditional methods. Second, we use a multitask loss to simultaneously obtain the segmentation and edge detection results. The attached structured edge detection branch can further refine the segmentation result and dramatically improve edge accuracy.

First of all the coarse latitude and longitude of the segmentation points between sea and land is obtained through applying coastline database to remote sensing images. Secondly on the basis of segmentation point, the region around coastline is divided into a group of blocks with 800x800 pixels. Finally SeNet is improved to separate the sea and land of the region.

Whole-slide images (WSIs) are an important standard for the diagnosis of cervical cancer. Missed diagnoses and misdiagnoses often occur due to the high similarity in pathological cervical images, the large number of readings, the long reading time, and the insufficient experience levels of pathologists. Existing models have insufficient feature extraction and representation capabilities, and they suffer from insufficient pathological classification. Therefore, this work first designs an image processing algorithm for data augmentation. Second, the deep convolutional features are extracted by fine-tuning pre-trained deep network models, including ResNet50 v2, DenseNet121, Inception v3, VGGNet19, and Inception-ResNet, and then local binary patterns and a histogram of the oriented gradient to extract traditional image features are used. Third, the features extracted by the fine-tuned models are serially fused according to the feature representation ability parameters and the accuracy of multiple experiments proposed in this paper, and spectral embedding is used for dimension reduction. Finally, the fused features are inputted into the Analysis of Variance-F value-Spectral Embedding Net (AF-SENet) for classification. There are four different pathological images of the dataset: normal, low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and cancer. The dataset is divided into a training set (90%) and a test set (10%). The serial fusion effect of the deep features extracted by Resnet50v2 and DenseNet121 (C-5) is the best, with average classification accuracy reaching 95.33%, which is 1.07% higher than ResNet50 v2 and 1.05% higher than DenseNet121. The recognition ability is significantly improved, especially in LSIL, reaching 90.89%, which is 2.88% higher than ResNet50 v2 and 2.1% higher than DenseNet121. Thus, this method significantly improves the accuracy and generalization ability of pathological cervical WSI recognition by fusing deep features.","[Huang, Pan; Tan, Xiaoheng; Li, Yongming] Chongqing Univ, Sch Microelect & Commun Engn, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chen] Xinjiang Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China; [Lv, Xiaoyi] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Software, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China",,"Huang, P (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ, Sch Microelect & Commun Engn, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.",panhuang@cqu.edu.cn; txh@cqu.edu.cn; chen9518chen@163.com; xjuwawj01@163.com; yongmingli@cqu.edu.cn,"Li, Yongming/AAP-2697-2020; Huang, Pan/AAC-5550-2021","Li, Yongming/0000-0002-7542-4356; Huang, Pan/0000-0001-8158-2628",Science and Technology Project on Aid to Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region [2019E0215]; National Science Foundation of China [61765014]; Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars [2019Q003],Science and Technology Project on Aid to Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars,"The Science and Technology Project on Aid to Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (2019E0215); The National Science Foundation of China (61765014), and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (2019Q003).",,43,8,8,9,38,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JAN,2021.0,21,1,,,,,,,122,10.3390/s21010122,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21010122,,,20,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,PQ0CX,33375508.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000606220400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, figuring out the relationship between miRNAs and diseases plays a critical role in not only the development of new drugs, but also the formulation of individualized diagnosis and treatment. As the prediction of miRNA-disease association via biological experiments is expensive and time-consuming, computational methods have a positive effect on revealing the association. In this study, a novel prediction model integrating GCN, CNN and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (GCSENet) was constructed for the identification of miRNA-disease association. The model first captured features by GCN based on a heterogeneous graph including diseases, genes and miRNAs. Then, considering the different effects of genes on each type of miRNA and disease, as well as the different effects of the miRNA-gene and disease-gene relationships on miRNA-disease association, a feature weight was set and a combination of miRNA-gene and disease-gene associations was added as feature input for the convolution operation in CNN. Furthermore, the squeeze and excitation blocks of SENet were applied to determine the importance of each feature channel and enhance useful features by means of the attention mechanism, thus achieving a satisfactory prediction of miRNA-disease association. The proposed method was compared against other state-of-the-art methods. It achieved an AUROC score of 95.02% and an AUPR score of 95.55% in a 10-fold cross-validation, which led to the finding that the proposed method is superior to these popular methods on most of the performance evaluation indexes. Author summary Identifying miRNA-disease associations accelerates the understanding towards pathogenicity, which is beneficial for the development of treatment tools for diseases. Different from existing methods, our GCSENet captures the deep relationship between miRNA and disease through three heterogeneous graphs (disease, gene and miRNA) to promote an accurate prediction result. We performed the 10-fold cross validation to evaluate the performance of GCSENet, which can outperform many classic methods. Furthermore, we carried out case studies on four important diseases, which were used to evaluate the performance of our model regarding to the associations with experimental evidences in literature. The result shows that most predicted miRNAs (48 for lung neoplasms, 48 for heart failure, 48 for breast cancer and 50 for glioblastoma) in the top 50 predictions were confirmed in HMDD v3.0. As a result, it shows that GCSENet can make reliable predictions and guide experiments to uncover more miRNA-disease associations.","[Li, Zhong; Jiang, Kaiyancheng; Qin, Shengwei; Zhong, Yijun] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Math Sci, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhong; Elofsson, Arne] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Sci Life Lab, Stockholm, Sweden",,"Li, Z (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Math Sci, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.;Li, Z (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Sci Life Lab, Stockholm, Sweden.",lizhong@zstu.edu.cn,,"Qin, Shengwei/0000-0001-6505-9650; zhong, yijun/0000-0001-8082-4103; Elofsson, Arne/0000-0002-7115-9751",National Natural Science Foundation of China [11671009]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LZ19A010002],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),"ZL was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 11671009 and Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. LZ19A010002.

Therefore a good sentence encoder for relation extraction is essential. Previous models use shallow convolution neural networks or recurrent neural networks like bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to extract features of a sentence. To enhance the representation power of network, in this paper we investigate the capability of Squeeze- and Excitation (SE) module on the task of distantly supervised noisy relation extraction.

To a large extent, their success in interpreting and responding to a request is dependent upon rich underlying ontologies and conceptual models that understand the technical or domain specific vocabulary of diverse users. The effective use of NL interfaces in the Software Engineering (SE) domains requires its own ontology models focusing upon software related terms and concepts. While many SE glossaries exist, they are often incomplete and tend to define the vocabulary for specific sub-fields without capturing associations between terms and phrases. This limits their usefulness for supporting NL-related tasks. In this paper we propose an approach for constructing and evolving a semantic network of software engineering concepts and phrases. Our approach starts with a set of existing SE glossaries, uses the existing glossary terms and explicitly defined associations as a starting point, uses machine learning-based techniques to dynamically identify and document additional associations between terms, leverages the network to interpret NL queries in the SE domain, and finally augments the resulting semantic network with feedback provided by users. We evaluate the viability of our approach within the sub-domain of Agile Software Development, focusing on requirements related queries, and show that the semantic network enhances the ability of an NL interface to correctly interpret and execute user queries.","[Liu, Yalin; Lin, Jinfeng; Cleland-Huang, Jane] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Vierhauser, Michael] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Linz, Austria; [Guo, Jin] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lohar, Sugandha] Depaul Univ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",,"Liu, YL (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",yliu26@nd.edu; jlin6@nd.edu; JaneHuang@nd.edu; michael.vierhauser@jku.at; jguo@cs.mcgill.ca; sonu1.123@gmail.com,"Vierhauser, Michael/AAG-5859-2021","Vierhauser, Michael/0000-0003-2672-9230",,,,,39,0,0,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-1-7281-8352-7,,,,2020.0,,,,,,,23,32,,10.1109/AIRE51212.2020.00011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/AIRE51212.2020.00011,,,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BR0TF,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000630449700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper proposes a new variational mode decomposition (VMD)-attention-based spatio-temporal network (VASTN) method that takes advantage of both temporal and spatial correlations of wind speed. First, VASTN is a hybrid wind speed prediction model that combines VMD, squeeze-and-excitation network (SENet), and attention mechanism (AM)-based bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). VASTN initially employs VMD to decompose the wind speed matrix into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). Then, to extract the spatial features at the bottom of the model, each IMF employs an improved convolutional neural network algorithm based on channel AM, also known as SENet. Second, it combines BiLSTM and AM at the top layer to extract aggregated spatial features and capture temporal dependencies. Finally, VASTN accumulates the predictions of each IMF to obtain the predicted wind speed. This method employs VMD to reduce the randomness and instability of the original data before employing AM to improve prediction accuracy through mapping weight and parameter learning. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate VASTN's superiority over previous related algorithms.","[Zhao, Yingnan; Ji, Guanlan; Chen, Fei; Ji, Peiyuan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Comp & Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Cao, Yi] Univ Windsor, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada",,"Zhao, YN (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Comp & Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",zh_yingnan@126.com,,,undergraduate training program for innovation and entrepreneurship of NUIST [XJDC202110300239],undergraduate training program for innovation and entrepreneurship of NUIST,This paper is supported by the undergraduate training program for innovation and entrepreneurship of NUIST (XJDC202110300239) .,,35,0,0,11,11,TECH SCIENCE PRESS,HENDERSON,"871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA",0267-6192,,,COMPUT SYST SCI ENG,Comput.

The degree of differentiation can reflect the degree of malignancy. The degree of malignancy of liver cancer can be divided into three types: poorly differentiated, moderately differentiated, and well differentiated. Diagnosis and treatment of different levels of differentiation are crucial to the survival rate and survival time of patients. As the gold standard for liver cancer diagnosis, histopathological images can accurately distinguish liver cancers of different levels of differentiation. Therefore, the study of intelligent classification of histopathological images is of great significance to patients with liver cancer. At present, the classification of histopathological images of liver cancer with different degrees of differentiation has disadvantages such as time-consuming, labor-intensive, and large manual investment. In this context, the importance of intelligent classification of histopathological images is obvious. Methods Based on the development of a complete data acquisition scheme, this paper applies the SENet deep learning model to the intelligent classification of all types of differentiated liver cancer histopathological images for the first time, and compares it with the four deep learning models of VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet_CBAM, and SKNet. The evaluation indexes adopted in this paper include confusion matrix, Precision, recall, F1 Score, etc. These evaluation indexes can be used to evaluate the model in a very comprehensive and accurate way. Results Five different deep learning classification models are applied to collect the data set and evaluate model. The experimental results show that the SENet model has achieved the best classification effect with an accuracy of 95.27%. The model also has good reliability and generalization ability. The experiment proves that the SENet deep learning model has a good application prospect in the intelligent classification of histopathological images. Conclusions This study also proves that deep learning has great application value in solving the time-consuming and laborious problems existing in traditional manual film reading, and it has certain practical significance for the intelligent classification research of other cancer histopathological images.","[Chen, Chen; Chen, Cheng; Lv, Xiaoyi; Yan, Ziwei] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Northwest Rd, Urumqi 830046, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Cheng; Lv, Xiaoyi; Yan, Ziwei] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Software, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chen] Xinjiang Univ, Key Lab Signal Detect & Proc, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China; [Ma, Mingrui; Ma, Xiaojian; Dong, Xiaogang] Xinjiang Med Univ, Canc Hosp, Suzhou East Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Min] Karamay Cent Hosp XinJiang Karamay, Dept Pathol, Karamay 834000, Xinjiang Uygur, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jiajia] Changji Vocat & Tech Coll, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China",,"Lv, XY (通讯作者)，Xinjiang Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Northwest Rd, Urumqi 830046, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.;Lv, XY (通讯作者)，Xinjiang Univ, Coll Software, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China.;Dong, XG (通讯作者)，Xinjiang Med Univ, Canc Hosp, Suzhou East Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",xiaoz813@163.com; 11418267@zju.edu.cn,,,"special scientific research project for young medical science [2019Q003]; Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Innovation Environment Construction special Project -Key Laboratory opening project [2022D04021]; Natural Science Foundation of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region [2022D01C290]; Karamay City Key R&D Project-Molecular Mechanism and Application of DNA Methylation Liquid Biopsy in the Prevention, Diagnosis and Treatment of Malignant Tumors","special scientific research project for young medical science; Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Innovation Environment Construction special Project -Key Laboratory opening project; Natural Science Foundation of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; Karamay City Key R&D Project-Molecular Mechanism and Application of DNA Methylation Liquid Biopsy in the Prevention, Diagnosis and Treatment of Malignant Tumors","This research was funded by the special scientific research project for young medical science (2019Q003), Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Innovation Environment Construction special Project -Key Laboratory opening project (2022D04021), Natural Science Foundation of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (2022D01C290) and Karamay City Key R&D Project-Molecular Mechanism and Application of DNA Methylation Liquid Biopsy in the Prevention, Diagnosis and Treatment of Malignant Tumors.",,54,0,0,17,17,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1472-6947,,BMC MED INFORM DECIS,BMC Med.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) measurement is an appropriate way to understand the underlying mechanisms of major depressive disorder (MDD) to distinguish depression from normal control. With the development of deep learning methods, many researchers have adopted deep learning models to improve the classification accuracy of depression recognition. However, there are few studies on designing convolution filters for spatial and frequency domain feature learning in different brain regions. In this study, SparNet, a convolutional neural network composed of five parallel convolutional filters and the SENet, is proposed to learn EEG space-frequency domain characteristics and distinguish between depressive and normal control. The model is trained and tested by the cross-validation method of subject division. The results show that SparNet achieves a sensitivity of 95.07%, a specificity of 93.66%, and an accuracy of 94.37% in classification. Therefore, our results can conclude that the proposed SparNet model is effective in detecting depression using EEG signals. It also indicates that the combination of spatial information and frequency domain information is an effective way to identify patients with depression.","[Deng, Xin; Fan, Xufeng; Lv, Xiangwei; Sun, Kaiwei] Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Key Lab Data Engn & Visual Comp, Chongqing, Peoples R China",,"Fan, XF (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Key Lab Data Engn & Visual Comp, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",xufengfan_c@163.com,,,,,,,46,0,0,9,9,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1662-5196,,FRONT NEUROINFORM,Front.

First of all, a residual module is added to the 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) to avoid problems such as gradient dispersion caused by the deepening of the network layer; Secondly, not only the global average pooling layer but also the global maximum pooling layer is used in the SENet network, which can fully extract global information and achieve feature calibration. In the meantime, expand the SENet network to three-dimensional, which can make the connection of the spatiotemporal feature channels closer. Afterwards, the 3D-SE module is introduced into the R3D network, which can enhance the effective spatiotemporal features and suppress the invalid spatiotemporal features; Since, because LSTM can perform timing modeling on high-level features and learn more effective feature information, the LSTM network is introduced into the SE-R3D network. Finally, Softmax is used for classification.

However, it is challenging for radiologists to evaluate HCC gradings from medical images. Purpose: In this study, a novel deep neural network was developed by combining the squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) in a three-dimensional (3D) densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet), which is referred to as a 3D SE-DenseNet, for the classification of HCC grading using enhanced clinical magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained from two different clinical centers. Method: In the proposed architecture, the SENet was added as an additional layer between the dense blocks of the 3D DenseNet, to mitigate the impact of feature redundancy. For the HCC grading task, the 3D SE-DenseNet was trained after data augmentation, and it outperformed the 3D DenseNet based on the clinical dataset. Results: The quantitative evaluations of the 3D SE-DenseNet on a two-class HCC grading task were conducted based on the dataset, which included 213 samples of the dynamic enhanced MR images. The proposed 3D SE-DenseNet demonstrated an accuracy of 83%, when compared with the 72% accuracy of the 3D DenseNet. Conclusion: Owing to the advantage of useful automatic feature learning by the SE layer, the 3D SE-DenseNet can simultaneously handle useful feature enhancement and superfluous feature suppression.

First, the proposed LC-PSENet introduces the nonsubsampled Laplacian pyramid to decompose polarimetric feature maps, so as to construct a multichannel PolSAR image based on the low-frequency subband and contour subband of these maps. It guides the network to perform feature mining and selection in the subbands of each polarimetric map in a supervised way, automatically balancing the contributions of polarimetric features and their subbands and the influence of interference information such as noise, making the network learning more efficient. Second, the method introduces squeeze-and-excitation operation in the convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform channel modeling on the polarimetric feature subbands. It strengthens the learning of the contributions of local maps of the polarimetric features and subbands, thereby, effectively combining the features of the polarimetric domain and the spatial domain. Experiments on the datasets of Flevoland, The Netherlands, and Oberpfaffenhofen show that the proposed LC-PSENet achieves overall accuracies of 99.66%, 99.72%, and 95.89%, which are 0.87%, 0.27%, and 1.42% higher than the baseline CNN, respectively. The isolated points in the classification results are obviously reduced, and the distinction between boundary and nonboundary is more clear and delicate. Also, the method performs better than many current state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy.","[Qin, Rui; Fu, Xiongjun; Lang, Ping] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Informat & Elect, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",,"Fu, XJ (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Informat & Elect, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",qinrui15@126.com; fuxiongjun@bit.edu.cn; langping911220@bit.edu.cn,,"Qin, Rui/0000-0003-1123-0090; Lang, Ping/0000-0002-5940-1824",National Natural Science Foundation of China [61571043]; 111 Project of China [B14010],"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 111 Project of China(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)",This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61571043 and in part by the 111 Project of China under Grant B14010.,,55,8,8,3,11,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1939-1404,2151-1535,,IEEE J-STARS,IEEE J.

However, several reasons make detection from aerial images very challenging and more difficult than nature scene images: Objects do not have a fixed size, often appear at very various scales and sometimes appear in dense groups, like vehicles and storage tanks, and have different surroundings or background areas. Furthermore, all of this makes the manual annotation of objects very complex and costly. The powerful effect of the feature extraction methods on object detection and the successes of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) extract deep features more than traditional methods. This study introduced a novel network structure and designed a unique feature extraction which employs squeeze and excitation network (SENet) and residual network (ResNet) to obtain feature maps, named a shallow-deep feature extraction (SDFE), that improves the resolution and the localization at the same time. Furthermore, this novel model reduces the loss of dense groups and small objects, and provides higher and more stable detection accuracy which is not significantly affected by changing the value of the threshold of the intersection over union (IoU) and overcomes the difficulties of RSIs. Moreover, this study introduced strong evidence about the factors that affect the detection of RSIs. The proposed shallow-deep and multi-scale (SD-MS) method outperforms other approaches for the given ten classes of the NWPU VHR-10 dataset.","[AL-Alimi, Dalal; Shao, Yuxiang; Feng, Ruyi] China Univ Geosci, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Al-qaness, Mohammed A.

We propose the MaSE-ResNeXt model based on the fundamental work in the SeNet that can enhance the feature connection between different channels. The MaSEResNeXt adopted hierarchical filter groups, bottleneck stacking, and other strategies to enhance the representational capability of the model which advances the solving ability in rock recognition. Six data enhancement methods and other techniques are used to improve the robustness and effectiveness. The accuracy in the test set was 90.89% and 81.97% for the first and second level, respectively, with the inference duration is only 0.0357s.

Because of the complex maritime environment, the sea-land segmentation is a challenging task. Although the neural network has achieved excellent performance in semantic segmentation in the last years, there were a few of works using CNN for sea-land segmentation and the results could be further improved. This paper proposes a novel deep convolution neural network named DeepUNet. Like the U-Net, its structure has a contracting path and an expansive path to get high-resolution optical output. But differently, the DeepUNet uses DownBlocks instead of convolution layers in the contracting path and uses UpBlock in the expansive path. The two novel blocks bring two new connections that are U-connection and Plus connection. They are promoted to get more precise segmentation results. To verify the network architecture, we construct a new challenging sea-land dataset and compare the DeepUNet on it with the U-Net, SegNet, and SeNet. Experimental results show that DeepUNet can improve 1-2% accuracy performance compared with other architectures, especially in high-resolution optical remote sensing imagery.","[Li, Ruirui; Liu, Wenjie; Yang, Lei; Sun, Shihao; Hu, Wei; Zhang, Fan; Li, Wei] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100096, Peoples R China",,"Li, RR (通讯作者)，Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100096, Peoples R China.",ilydouble@gmail.com; 1186894139@qq.com; ylxx@live.com; 472527311@qq.com; huwei@mail.buct.edu.cn; zhangf@mail.buct.edu.cn; liw@mail.buct.edu.cn,"LI, WEI/ABD-5001-2021; Li, Ruirui/AAL-4473-2020; Zhang, Fan/W-3340-2019","Zhang, Fan/0000-0002-2058-2373","National Natural Science Foundation of China [91638201, 61501018, 61571033]; Higher Education and High-Quality and World-Class Universities [PY201619]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Higher Education and High-Quality and World-Class Universities,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 91638201, Grant 61501018, Grant 61571033 and in part by the Higher Education and High-Quality and World-Class Universities (PY201619).",,35,148,167,35,131,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1939-1404,2151-1535,,IEEE J-STARS,IEEE J.

However, if the aneurysm can be found and treated during asymptomatic periods, the probabil-ity of rupture can be greatly reduced. At present, time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography is one of the most commonly used non-invasive screening techniques for cerebral aneurysm, and the application of deep learning technology in aneurysm detection can effectively improve the screening effect of aneurysm. Existing studies have found that three-dimensional features play an important role in aneurysm detec-tion, but they require a large amount of training data and have problems such as a high number of FPs per case.Methods: This paper proposed a novel method for aneurysm detection. First, a fully automatic cerebral artery segmentation algorithm without training data was used to extract the volume of interest, and then the 3D U-Net was improved by the 3D SENet module to establish an aneurysm detection model. Eventually a set of fully automated, end-to-end aneurysm detection methods have been formed.Results: A total of 231 magnetic resonance angiography image data were used in this study, among which 132 were training sets, 34 were internal test sets and 65 were external test sets. The presented method obtained 97.89 +/- 0.88% sensitivity in the five-fold cross-validation and obtained 90.8% sensitivity with 2.47 FPs/case in the detection of the external test sets.Conclusions: Compared with the results of our previous studies and other studies, the method in this paper achieves the best sensitivity while maintaining low number of FPs per case. This result proves the feasibility, superiority, and further improvement potential of the improved method combining 3D U-Net and channel attention in the task of aneurysm detection.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

First, a sub-window box filter was used to construct the scale space for fully retaining the scale-space image's edge and corner information. Second, the FAST algorithm was used to extract the scale-space feature points for increasing the speed of feature-point extraction, and the circular non-maximum suppression algorithm was used to suppress the scale-space feature points. It was optimized to improve the accuracy. Then, the SENet attention mechanism was added to the HardNet feature-extraction network to form the Attention-HardNet network, which extracted more robust 128-dimensional floating-point feature descriptors. Finally, L2 distance was used to measure the similarity of different descriptors. The image' s feature-point matching was complete. On the Oxford dataset, tests on the matching algorithm's anti-scale, compression and illumination performances show that when compared with the commonly used matching algorithms, the matching accuracy rate of the proposed algorithm has been greatly improved. Compared with the deep learning methods such as L2net and HardNet, the matching accuracy rate of the proposed algorithm is increased by similar to 3%, and the speed is increased by similar to 10%.","[Qi Xiangming; Feng Yifan] Liaoning Tech Univ, Coll Software, Huludao 125105, Liaoning, Peoples R China",,"Feng, YF (通讯作者)，Liaoning Tech Univ, Coll Software, Huludao 125105, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",18342960860@163.com,,,,,,,26,0,0,9,9,"SHANGHAI INST OPTICS & FINE MECHANICS, CHINESE ACAD SCIENCE",SHANGHAI," 390, QINGHE LU, SHANGHAI, JIADING-QU, PEOPLES R CHINA",1006-4125,,,LASER OPTOELECTRON P,Laser Optoelectron.

We aimed to propose an effective modification and calculated the volume-based modified LM score (VMLMs), which should correlate more strongly with clinical symptoms than the TLMs. Methods: Semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labels used for self-training was adopted to train our convolutional neural networks, with the algorithm including a combination of MobileNet, SENet, and ResNet. A total of 175 CT sets, with 50 participants that would undergo sinus surgery, were recruited. The Sinonasal Outcomes Test-22 (SNOT-22) was used to assess disease-specific symptoms before and after surgery. A 3D-projected view was created and VMLMs were calculated for further comparison. Results: Our methods showed a significant improvement both in sinus classification and segmentation as compared to state-of-the-art networks, with an average Dice coefficient of 91.57%, an MioU of 89.43%, and a pixel accuracy of 99.75%. The sinus volume exhibited sex dimorphism. There was a significant positive correlation between volume and height, but a trend toward a negative correlation between maxillary sinus and age. Subjects who underwent surgery had significantly greater TLMs (14.9 vs. 7.38) and VMLMs (11.65 vs. 4.34) than those who did not. ROC-AUC analyses showed that the VMLMs had excellent discrimination at classifying a high probability of postoperative improvement with SNOT-22 reduction. Conclusions: Our method is suitable for obtaining detailed information, excellent sinus boundary prediction, and differentiating the target from its surrounding structure. These findings demonstrate the promise of CT-based volumetric analysis of sinus mucosal inflammation.","[Kuo, Chung-Feng Jeffrey; Liao, Yu-Shu; Barman, Jagadish] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Taipei 114, Taiwan; [Liu, Shao-Cheng] Triserv Gen Hosp, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Natl Def Med Ctr, 325,Sec 2,Cheng Gong Rd, Taipei 114, Taiwan",,"Liu, SC (通讯作者)，Triserv Gen Hosp, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Natl Def Med Ctr, 325,Sec 2,Cheng Gong Rd, Taipei 114, Taiwan.",jeffreykuo@mail.ntust.edu.tw; jeffrey6349754@gmail.com; D10904820@mail.ntust.edu.tw; m871435@ndmctsgh.edu.tw,,"Liu, Shao-Cheng/0000-0001-9730-1798; Liao, Yu-Shu/0000-0003-3285-146X","Tri-Service General Hospital [TSGH-A111004, TSGH-NTUST-111-03, MND-MAB-D-111116]; National Defense Medical Center [TSGH-A111004, TSGH-NTUST-111-03, MND-MAB-D-111116]; National Taiwan University of Science and Technology [TSGH-A111004, TSGH-NTUST-111-03, MND-MAB-D-111116]",Tri-Service General Hospital; National Defense Medical Center; National Taiwan University of Science and Technology,"The research was supported by the Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center and National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Joint Research Program (TSGH-A111004, TSGH-NTUST-111-03, MND-MAB-D-111116).

Since the Senet Group's dissolution in 2020, the campaign has been overseen by the Betting and Gambling Council (BGC), the main gambling industry trade body. There has been no prior analysis of the activities, ideas and framing adopted by the Senet Group, who claimed to be acting as an industry 'watchdog' and oversaw what they characterised as a major public education campaign. We collated written and image-based material related to the Senet Group and its When the Fun Stops, Stop campaign from multiple sources. Guided by Entman's four functions of framing, we analysed the Senet Group's framing of the issues it sought to address, particularly harmful gambling, as well as its causes, and the solutions, focusing on the group's main activity: the delivery of the When the Fun Stops, Stop campaign. We also critically appraised an evaluation of the campaign funded by the Senet Group, using the findings to interrogate the stated claims about the campaign's effectiveness. The analysis showed that the Senet Group's framing of the problem, its causes, and proposed responses resemble those adopted by other industries and industry-funded groups. This involves portraying any harms caused by their products as limited to an atypical minority, rejecting upstream determinants of harm, and promoting individually-targeted voluntary measures, all contrary to the evidence of what works in health promotion, and what would characterise a public health approach. Neither the existing evidence base nor the evidence presented by the Senet Group support their claims about the campaign's effectiveness. These findings add to concerns about industry-funded campaigns in other areas. To minimise conflicts of interest, interventions intended to address gambling-related harms, such as public education campaigns, should be evidence-based and developed, implemented and evaluated completely independent of the industry and industry-funded organisations.","[van Schalkwyk, May C.

However, such methods are designed for a finite sample dataset and lack the ability to generalize to out-of-sample data. Moreover, since the number of self-expressive coefficients grows quadratically with the number of data points, their ability to handle large-scale datasets is often limited. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for subspace clustering, termed Self-Expressive Network (SENet), which employs a properly designed neural network to learn a self-expressive representation of the data. We show that our SENet can not only learn the self-expressive coefficients with desired properties on the training data, but also handle out-of-sample data. Besides, we show that SENet can also be leveraged to perform subspace clustering on large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic data and real world benchmark data validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, SENet yields highly competitive performance on MNIST, Fashion MNIST and Extended MNIST and state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10.","[Zhang, Shangzhi; Li, Chun-Guang] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing, Peoples R China; [You, Chong] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept EECS, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Vidal, Rene] Johns Hopkins Univ, Math Inst Data Sci, Baltimore, MD USA",,"Zhang, SZ (通讯作者)，Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,"You, Chong/AAV-3338-2020","You, Chong/0000-0001-7821-2378","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61876022]; Northrop Grumman Mission Systems Research in Applications for Learning Machines; NSF [1704458, 2031985, 1934979]; Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute Research Fund",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Northrop Grumman Mission Systems Research in Applications for Learning Machines; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute Research Fund,"S.

Various deep learning models have been proposed to extract building information, showing both strengths and weaknesses in capturing the complex spectral and spatial characteristics of buildings in remote sensing images. To integrate the strengths of individual models and obtain fine-scale spatial and spectral building information, this study proposed a stacking ensemble deep learning model. First, an optimization method for the prediction results of the basic model is proposed based on fully connected conditional random fields (CRFs). On this basis, a stacking ensemble model (SENet) based on a sparse autoencoder integrating U-NET, SegNet, and FCN-8s models is proposed to combine the features of the optimized basic model prediction results. Utilizing several cities in Hebei Province, China as a case study, a building dataset containing attribute labels is established to assess the performance of the proposed model. The proposed SENet is compared with three individual models (U-NET, SegNet and FCN-8s), and the results show that the accuracy of SENet is 0.954, approximately 6.7%, 6.1%, and 9.8% higher than U-NET, SegNet, and FCN-8s models, respectively. The identification of building features, including colors, sizes, shapes, and shadows, is also evaluated, showing that the accuracy, recall, F1 score, and intersection over union (IoU) of the SENet model are higher than those of the three individual models. This suggests that the proposed ensemble model can effectively depict the different features of buildings and provides an alternative approach to building extraction with higher accuracy.","[Cao, Duanguang; Xing, Hanfa] Shandong Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm, Jinan 250000, Peoples R China; [Xing, Hanfa] South China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Guangzhou 510000, Peoples R China; [Xing, Hanfa] SCNU Qingyuan Inst Sci & Technol Innovat Co Ltd, Qingyuan 511517, Peoples R China; [Xing, Hanfa] Guangdong Normal Univ Weizhi Informat Technol Co, Qingyuan 511517, Peoples R China; [Wong, Man Sing; Meng, Yuan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Man Sing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Res Inst Sustainable Urban Dev, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kwan, Mei-Po] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kwan, Mei-Po] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Space & Earth Informat Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kwan, Mei-Po] Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands; [Xing, Huaqiao] Shandong Jianzhu Univ, Sch Surveying & Geoinformat, Jinan 250101, Peoples R China",,"Xing, HF (通讯作者)，Shandong Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm, Jinan 250000, Peoples R China.;Xing, HF (通讯作者)，South China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Guangzhou 510000, Peoples R China.;Xing, HF (通讯作者)，SCNU Qingyuan Inst Sci & Technol Innovat Co Ltd, Qingyuan 511517, Peoples R China.;Xing, HF (通讯作者)，Guangdong Normal Univ Weizhi Informat Technol Co, Qingyuan 511517, Peoples R China.",cdguang@foxmail.com; xinghanfa@sdnu.edu.cn; ls.charles@polyu.edu.hk; mpk654@gmail.com; xinghuaqiao@126.com; myuan.meng@connect.polyu.hk,"Kwan, Mei-Po/S-4162-2016","Kwan, Mei-Po/0000-0001-8602-9258; Cao, Duanguang/0000-0002-3529-1093","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41971406]; General Research Fund [15602619]; Collaborative Research Fund [C7064-18GF]; Research Institute for Sustainable Urban Development [1-BBWD]; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Research Grants Council [14605920, C4023-20GF]; Research Committee on Research Sustainability of Major Research Grants Council Funding Schemes of the Chinese University of Hong Kong",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); General Research Fund; Collaborative Research Fund; Research Institute for Sustainable Urban Development; Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University); Hong Kong Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Research Committee on Research Sustainability of Major Research Grants Council Funding Schemes of the Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Hanfa Xing thanks the funding support from a grant by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 41971406).

Board games are situated theoretically as liminoid practices, which lie outside the bounds of normative social behaviour and allow for interaction across social boundaries. Utilizing double-sided game boards, with an indigenous game on one side and a newly introduced game on the other, the games of senet, mehen and twenty squares provide evidence for social interactions. Cypriots had adopted Egyptian mehen and senet by the third millennium BC, and indigenized the games. This lies in contrast to the game of twenty squares, which had a particular role among elites in the Late Bronze Age interaction sphere.

However, such practices would inevitably lead to information loss or the selection of noisy patches that would affect estimation accuracy In this paper, we regard patch selection in neural network based illuminant estimation as a controlling problem of selecting image patches that could help remove noisy patches and improve estimation accuracy To achieve this, we construct a selection network (SeNet) to learn a patch selection policy. Based on data statistics and the learning progression state of the deep illuminant estimation network (DeNet), the SeNs decides which training patches should be input to the DeNet, which in turn gives feedback to the SeNet fc it to update its selection policy. To achieve such interactive and intelligent learning, we utilize a reinforcement learning approach termed policy gradient to optimize the SeNet. We show that the proposed learning strategy can enhance the illuminant estimation accuracy, speed up the convergence and improve the stability of the training process of DeNet. We evaluate our method on two public datasets and demonstrate of method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Such integration, however, has mostly been carried out within supervised learning settings, without taking advantage of the power of the latest self-supervised learning models, which have demonstrated remarkable capability of extracting knowledge from large training sets. In this paper, we present K-SENet, a knowledge-assisted waveform framework for speech enhancement. Wave-U-Net is utilized as the baseline model and the foundation to build our framework. To achieve enhanced intelligibility, we propose a perceptual loss function that relies on self-supervised speech representations pretrained on large datasets, to provide guidance for the baseline network. Wav2vec and PASE are the choices of self-supervised models in this work. Our proposed perceptual loss is calculated upon the perceptual similarities captured by the speech representations. Minimizing this loss would ensure the denoised network outputs sound like clean human speeches.

There are two main methods for the reconstruction of porous media: physical experimental methods and numerical reconstruction methods. The former are usually expensive and restricted by the limited size of experimental samples, while the latter are relatively cost-effective but still suffer from a lengthy processing time and unsatisfactory performance. With the vigorous development of deep learning in recent years, applying deep learning methods to 3D reconstruction of porous media has become an important direction. Variational auto-encoder (VAE) is one of the typical deep learning methods with a strong ability of extracting features from training images (TIs), but it has the problem of posterior collapse, meaning the generated data from the decoder are not related to its input data, i.e. the latent space Z. This paper proposes a VAE model (called SE-FBN-VAE) based on squeeze-and-excitation network (SENet) and fixed batch normalization (FBN) for the reconstruction of porous media. SENet is a simple and efficient channel attention mechanism, which improves the sensitivity of the model to channel characteristics. The application of SENet to VAE can further improve its ability of extracting features from TIs. Batch normalization (BN) is a common method for data normalization in neural networks, which reduces the convergence time of the network. In this paper, BN is slightly modified to solve the problem of posterior collapse of VAE. Compared with some other numerical methods, the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method are demonstrated.","[Zhang, Ting; Yang, Yi; Zhang, Anqin] Shanghai Univ Elect Power, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200090, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, AQ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Elect Power, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200090, Peoples R China.",shiep2021@yeah.net,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41672114, 41702148]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41672114, 41702148).",,43,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1420-0597,1573-1499,,COMPUTAT GEOSCI,Comput.

The present findings are in agreement with previous results using different approximations and partitioning schemes [P. Senet and F. Aparicio, J. Chem. Phys. 126, 145105 (2007)]. In addition, we show that the polarizability of the side chain of an amino acid depends mainly on its number of electrons (reflecting its size) and consequently cannot be used to cluster the amino acids in different biochemical groups, in contrast to the local softness. Our results also demonstrate that the global softness is not simply proportional to the global polarizability in disagreement with the intuition that a softer moiety is also more polarizable. Amino acids with the same softness may have a polarizability differing by a factor as large as 1.7. This discrepancy can be understood from first principles as we show that the molecular polarizability depends on a softness dipole vector and not simply on the global softness.","[Krishtal, Alisa; Van Alsenoy, Christian] Univ Antwerp, Dept Chem, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne, Inst Carnot Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 5209, F-21078 Dijon, France",,"Krishtal, A (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Chem, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",psenet@u-bourgogne.fr,,,Flemish FWO [G. 0629.06],Flemish FWO(FWO),A.

The requirement of data collecting and the characteristics of point clouds limit the development of semantic segmentation technology in point clouds. Therefore, this paper proposes a neural network model named PointCartesian-Net that uses only 3D coordinates of point cloud data for semantic segmentation. First, to increase the feature information and reduce the loss of geometric information, the 3D coordinates are encoded to establish a connection between neighboring points. Second, a dense connect and residual connect are employed to progressively increase the receptive field for each 3D point, and aggregated multi-level and multi-scale semantic features obtain rich contextual information. Third, inspired by the success of the SENet model in 2D images, a 3D SENet that learns the relation between the characteristic channels is proposed.

In this paper, we take advantage of this finding to create a simplified network based on a query-independent formulation, which maintains the accuracy of NLNet but with significantly less computation. We further observe that this simplified design shares similar structure with Squeeze-Excitation Network (SENet). Hence we unify them into a three-step general framework for global context modeling. Within the general framework, we design a better instantiation, called the global context (GC) block, which is lightweight and can effectively model the global context.

Recent studies mostly adopt graph neural networks to learn node embeddings, then apply traditional clustering methods to obtain clusters. However, they usually suffer from the following issues: (1) they adopt original graph structure which is unfavorable for clustering due to its noise and sparsity problems; (2) they mainly utilize non-clustering driven losses that cannot well capture the global cluster structure, thus the learned embeddings are not sufficient for the downstream clustering task. In this paper, we propose a spectral embedding network for attributed graph clustering (SENet), which improves graph structure by leveraging the information of shared neighbors, and learns node embeddings with the help of a spectral clustering loss. By combining the original graph structure and shared neighbor based similarity, both the first-order and second-order proximities are encoded into the improved graph structure, thus alleviating the noise and sparsity issues. To make the spectral loss well adapt to attributed graphs, we integrate both structure and feature information into kernel matrix via a higher-order graph convolution. Experiments on benchmark attributed graphs show that SENet achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The framework consists of two sequential networks: (1) scale estimation network (SENet) and (2) head detection network. SENet predicts the distribution of scales from the input image in the form of histogram. Then the scale histogram adjust anchor scale set of region proposal network that generates object proposals.

Most of the existing micro-expression recognition methods are based on manual feature extraction of subtle movements of facial muscles. Due to its short duration and weak intensity, the accurate identification of micro-expression remains a challenging task. This paper investigates micro-expression recognition based on deep learning methods and proposes a three-dimensional SE-DenseNet architecture, which fused Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks with a 3D DenseNet and can automatically integrate the spatiotemporal features extracted from each video to increase the weight of valid feature maps. The proposed architecture first obtains apex frames from each video for the most obvious facial muscle movements and then amplifies facial muscle movements using Euler video magnification to significantly alleviate the issue of small sample size and weak intensity of micro-expression recognition. Finally, the pre-processed videos are fed into the 3D SE-DenseNet for further feature extraction as well as to perform micro-expression classification. Experiments are performed on three public datasets. Our best model obtains an overall accuracy of 95.12%, 92.96%, and 82.74% on SMIC, CAS(ME)(2) and CASME-II dataset, respectively.

The CNNSCA network models that achieve cryptanalysis mainly include CNNSCA based on the VGG variant (VGG-CNNSCA) and CNNSCA based on the Alexnet variant (Alex-CNNSCA). The learning ability and cryptanalysis performance of these CNNSCA models are not optimal, and the trained model has low accuracy, too long training time, and takes up more computing resources. In order to improve the overall performance of CNNSCA, the paper will improve CNNSCA model design and hyperparameter optimization. Methods: The paper first studied the CNN architecture composition in the SCA application scenario, and derives the calculation process of the CNN core algorithm for side-channel leakage of one-dimensional data. Secondly, a new basic model of CNNSCA was designed by comprehensively using the advantages of VGG-CNNSCA model classification and fitting efficiency and Alex-CNNSCA model occupying less computing resources, in order to better reduce the gradient dispersion problem of error back propagation in deep networks, the SE (Squeeze-and-Excitation) module is newly embedded in this basic model, this module is used for the first time in the CNNSCA model, which forms a new idea for the design of the CNNSCA model. Then apply this basic model to a known first-order masked dataset from the side-channel leak public database (ASCAD). In this application scenario, according to the model design rules and actual experimental results, exclude non-essential experimental parameters. Optimize the various hyperparameters of the basic model in the most objective experimental parameter interval to improve its cryptanalysis performance, which results in a hyper-parameter optimization scheme and a final benchmark for the determination of hyper-parameters. Results: Finally, a new CNNSCA model optimized architecture for attacking unprotected encryption devices is obtained-CNNSCAnew. Through comparative experiments, CNNSCAnew's guessing entropy evaluation results converged to 61. From model training to successful recovery of the key, the total time spent was shortened to about 30 min, and we obtained better performance than other CNNSCA models.","[Liu, Yun Lin; Chen, Yan Kai; Li, Wei Xiong; Zhang, Yang] Army Engn Univ, Ctr Equipment Simulat Training, Shijiazhuang Campus, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China",,"Liu, YL (通讯作者)，Army Engn Univ, Ctr Equipment Simulat Training, Shijiazhuang Campus, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China.",llyun324@163.com,,"linyun, liu/0000-0001-6704-4102",,,,,40,1,1,2,4,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",,2376-5992,,PEERJ COMPUT SCI,PeerJ Comput.

A broad range of prior research has investigated the spatial component of this relationship, seeking to strengthen the representational power of a CNN by enhancing the quality of spatial encodings throughout its feature hierarchy. In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architectures that generalise extremely effectively across different datasets. We further demonstrate that SE blocks bring significant improvements in performance for existing state-of-the-art CNNs at slight additional computational cost. Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and reduced the top-5 error to 2.251 percent, surpassing the winning entry of 2016 by a relative improvement of similar to 25 percent.

The channel attention designed in SENet has made a great contribution to the promotion of the attention convolution model. However, our research found that SENet focuses on certain feature channels rather than objects in the channels. It will simultaneously enhance or weaken the target objects and background information in a certain channel. On the basis of the channel attention convolution network, we first perform channel sorting and group convolution on the feature map, and expand each group to beta times the original feature channel during the group convolution process to construct a channel expansion convolution network (CENet), where beta is an array used to represent the channel expansion coefficient. CENet captures the attention of objects in the feature channel while expanding the proportion of features in the relatively important channel. Furthermore, we improved the structure of CENet and merged it into the intra-layer multi-scale convolutional model to construct an object-level attention multi-scale convolutional neural network (OAMS-CNN). We have conducted a large number of experiments on four data sets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FGVC-Aircraft and Stanford Cars.

However, the commonly used global average pooling in some implementations aggregates a three-dimensional feature map to a one-dimensional attention map, leading a significant loss of structural information in the attention learning. In this article, we present a novel Spatial Pyramid Attention Network (SPANet), which exploits the structural information and channel relationships for better feature representation. SPANet enhances a base network by adding Spatial Pyramid Attention (SPA) blocks laterally. By rethinking the self-attention mechanism design, we further present three topology structures of attention path connection for our SPANet. They can be flexibly applied to various CNN architectures. SPANet is conceptually simple but practically powerful. It uses both structural regularization and structural information to achieve better learning capability. We have comprehensively evaluated the performance of SPANet on four benchmark datasets for different visual tasks. The experimental results show that SPANet significantly improves the recognition accuracy without adding much computation overhead. Using SPANet, we achieve an improvement of 1.6% top-1 classification accuracy on the ImageNet 2012 benchmark based on ResNet50, and SPANet outperforms SENet and other attention methods. SPANet also significantly improves the object detection performance by a clear margin with negligible additional computation overhead. When applying SPANet to RetinaNet based on the ResNet50 backbone, we improve the performance of the baseline model by 2.3 mAP and the enhanced model outperforms SENet and GCNet by 1.1 mAP and 1.7 mAP respectively.

Through the image processing and analysis technology to automatically analyze the image content to complete the management and retrieval of images, this process is the main content for image classification. Faced with massive digital Chinese art works, how to achieve effective management and retrieval for them has become an urgent problem to be solved. Traditional image retrieval technology is mainly based on image annotation, which has many problems, such as large workload and not objective enough. In this paper, we propose a depthwise separable squeeze-and-excitation selective kernel network (DSSESKN) for art image classification. SKNet (Slective Kernel Network) is used to adaptively adjust the receptive field to extract the global and detailed features of the image. We use SENet (squeeze-and-excitation network) to enhance the channel features. SKNet and SENet are fused to built the DSSESKN. The convolution kernel on the branch of DSSESKN module is used to extract the global feature and local detail features of the input image. The feature maps on the branches are fused, and the fused feature maps are compressed and activated. The processed feature weights are mapped to the feature maps of different branches and feature fusion is carried out. Art images are classified by deep separable convolution. Finally, we conduct experiments with other state-of-the-art classification methods, the results show that the effectiveness of the DSSESKN obtains the better effect.","[Zhang, Shaojie] Zhengzhou Univ Ind Technol, Sch Art & Design, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, SJ (通讯作者)，Zhengzhou Univ Ind Technol, Sch Art & Design, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China.",352720214@qq.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,2,3,"INST COMPUTER SCIENCES, SOCIAL INFORMATICS & TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENG-ICST",GHENT,"BEGIJNHOFLAAN 93, GHENT, 90000, BELGIUM",2032-9407,,,EAI ENDORSED TRANS S,EAI Endorsed Trans.

Iris segmentation is the most critical step in the iris recognition process. The accuracy of the iris segmentation algorithm directly affects the performance of the entire iris recognition system.In this study, an iris image segmentation algorithm SRN-UNet (SeResNext-UNet) is proposed to solve the problem of low segmentation accuracy for segmenting low-quality iris images. In the coding stage, the SE-ResNext module is added, which is cascaded with the SENet (Squeeze-and-Excitation Network) module after the RexNext module. The ResNext module can improve the network performance without increasing the network parameters; the SENet module builds a network model from the perspective of feature channel correlation through squeeze, excitation, and weight redistribution. For low-quality iris images, the SENet uses global information to selectively emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, and improve the accuracy of iris segmentation. In the up-sampling layer of the decoding stage, the amount of model parameters is reduced to increase the training speed. In order to solve the problem of image category imbalance, the SRN-UNet is trained by combining the Focal loss function and the Dice loss function. Among them, the Focal loss function can reduce the weight of easy-to-classify samples, make the model pay more attention to the training of difficult samples, and guide the network to retain complex boundary details; the Dice loss function can solve the problem of pixel category imbalance and alleviate the noise caused by the Focal loss function. Experimental results based on CASIA-Iris dataset and self-built low-quality iris image dataset show that compared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm has better segmentation effects in terms of visual effects and objective evaluation indicators. Among them, the Mean Intersection Over Union of the proposed algorithm reached 95.19%, the F1 score reached 97.48%, and the Precision reached 97.82%. Compared with U-Net, the Mean Intersection Over Union, F1 score and Precision of proposed algorithm have increased by 4.20%, 2.27%, and 5.38% respectively, and the algorithm is faster than U-Net.","[Tian Huijuan; Zhai Jiahao; Liu Jiawei; Deng Linlin] Tiangong Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Optoelect Detect Technol & Syst, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China; [Tian Huijuan; Zhai Jiahao; Liu Jiawei; Deng Linlin] Minist Educ High Power Solid State Lighting Appli, Engn Res Ctr, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China; [Liu Jianxin] Tianjin Chengke Transmiss Electromech Technol Ltd, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China",,"Tian, HJ (通讯作者)，Tiangong Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Optoelect Detect Technol & Syst, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China.;Tian, HJ (通讯作者)，Minist Educ High Power Solid State Lighting Appli, Engn Res Ctr, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China.",tianhjg@126.com,,,,,,,23,2,2,1,1,SCIENCE PRESS,EPHRATA,"300 WEST CHESNUT ST, EPHRATA, PA 17522 USA",1004-4213,,,ACTA PHOTONICA SINIC,Acta Photonica Sinica,FEB,2022.0,51,2,,,,,,,210006,10.3788/gzxb20225102.0210006,http://dx.doi.org/10.3788/gzxb20225102.0210006,,,9,Optics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Optics,1Y3LW,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000808045500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

For accurate counting, many excellent algorithms have been proposed, but there are still some challenges in terms of scale variation, occlusion, inaccurate counting in various backgrounds and so forth. In this paper, we propose a new model EFCCNN (Enhanced Feature Channel Convolutional Neural Network) to deal with these challenges. The proposed EFCCNN model has three main contributions. We propose a new convolutional neural network, which can be trained by end-to-end, and it performs better than other crowd counting networks. Additionally, we use SENet (Squeeze-and-Excitation Network) structure to change the channel weight, which can enhance the significant channel, and we use residual structure to transmit the channel weight to improve the counting precision. The SENet structure is helpful to solve the problem of scale variation and occlusion. The EFCCNN model is the first crowd counting model using channel weight information. Furthermore, a new loss function focusing on the structural information of images is proposed, which reduces the mean absolute error of crowd counting, effectively solves the problem of inaccurate counting in various backgrounds, such as crowd miscounting in the tree and brush background, and improves the quality of the crowd density map on SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure). Experiments on ShanghaiTech, Mall, UCF_CC_50 dataset show that EFCCNN have a lower mean absolute error of crowd counting and a higher quality density map.","[Bian, Yinlong; Shen, Jie; Xiong, Xin; Li, Ying; He, Wei; Li, Peng] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China",,"Bian, YL (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",uestcbyl@gmail.com; sjie@uestc.edu.cn; cumul.x@gmail.com; 201821080824@std.uestc.edu.cn; 201852080826@std.uestc.edu.cn; 201852080827@std.uestc.edu.cn,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,1,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",1082-3409,,978-1-7281-3798-8,PROC INT C TOOLS ART,,,2019.0,,,,,,,824,831,,10.1109/ICTAI.2019.00118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2019.00118,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BP4NY,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000553441500109,View Full Record in Web of Science

Through the image processing and analysis technology to automatically analyze the image content to complete the management and retrieval of images, this process is the main content for image classification. Faced with massive digital Chinese art works, how to achieve effective management and retrieval for them has become an urgent problem to be solved. Traditional image retrieval technology is mainly based on image annotation, which has many problems, such as large workload and not objective enough. In this paper, we propose a depthwise separable squeeze-and-excitation selective kernel network (DSSESKN) for art image classification. SKNet (Slective Kernel Network) is used to adaptively adjust the receptive field to extract the global and detailed features of the image. We use SENet (squeeze-and-excitation network) to enhance the channel features. SKNet and SENet are fused to built the DSSESKN. The convolution kernel on the branch of DSSESKN module is used to extract the global feature and local detail features of the input image. The feature maps on the branches are fused, and the fused feature maps are compressed and activated. The processed feature weights are mapped to the feature maps of different branches and feature fusion is carried out. Art images are classified by deep separable convolution. Finally, we conduct experiments with other state-of -the-art classification methods, the results show that the effectiveness of the DSSESKN obtains the better effect.","[Zhang, Shaojie] Zhengzhou Univ Ind Technol, Sch Art & Design, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, SJ (通讯作者)，Zhengzhou Univ Ind Technol, Sch Art & Design, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China.",352720214@qq.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,2,3,"INST COMPUTER SCIENCES, SOCIAL INFORMATICS & TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENG-ICST",GHENT,"BEGIJNHOFLAAN 93, GHENT, 90000, BELGIUM",2032-9407,,,EAI ENDORSED TRANS S,EAI Endorsed Trans.

The traditional machine learning based detection methods can make full use of informative features but cannot extract high-level representations. Other methods involved deep learning neural networks exploit propagation structural information to achieve high accuracy, for example, Bi-Directional Graph Convolution Networks(BiGCN) achieved the best performance on rumor detection by operating on bottom-up and top-down structures. However, those deep learning methods ignore other useful features like content-based features. In this paper, we not only make full use of three aspects of features based on a new concept: kernel subtree, which focus more on informative features of influential nodes of an event, but also propose a new model, which consists of Separation Convolution blocks, Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) and Squeeze and Excitation Networks(SENet), to make comprehensive use of features extracted on the basis of kernel subtree. First, we utilize Separation Convolutions to learn more local information with different kernel size, then LSTM can learn high-level interactions among features and find more global information. After that, SENet applies attention mechanism to put more weights on informative channels of feature maps. Meanwhile, on test set, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT) is used to assist our model with few events. The experiments on the PHEME dataset show that our approach can identify rumors with accuracy 95% which outperforms BiGCN by 10% at least.","[Wei, Ziyu; Xiao, Xi; Xia, Shutao] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Xi; Zhang, Bin; Xia, Shutao] Peng Cheng Lab, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Guangwu] Shenzhen Inst Informat Technol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Qing] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",,"Wei, ZY (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China.",weizy19@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; xiaox@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn; hugw@sziit.edu.cn; bin.zhang@pcl.ac.cn; liq8@sustech.edu.cn; xiast@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB1800204, 2018YFB1800601]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972219]; RD Program of Shenzhen [JCYJ20190813174403598, SGDX20190918101201696]; National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2018A030313422]; University-Enterprise Collaboration Project of Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); RD Program of Shenzhen; National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); University-Enterprise Collaboration Project of Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology,"This work is supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFB1800204), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61972219), the RD Program of Shenzhen (JCYJ20190813174403598, SGDX20190918101201696), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFB1800601), the National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2018A030313422), the University-Enterprise Collaboration Project of Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology.",,33,0,0,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2161-4393,,978-0-7381-3366-9,IEEE IJCNN,,,2021.0,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9534311,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9534311,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BS4TO,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000722581708006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of text-independent speaker verification is to determine whether two given uncontrolled utterances originate from the same speaker or not. Extracting speech features for each speaker using deep neural networks is a promising direction to explore and a straightforward solution is to train the discriminative feature extraction network by using a metric learning loss function. However, a single loss function often has certain limitations. Thus, we use deep multi-metric learning to address the problem and introduce three different losses for this problem, i.e., triplet loss, n-pair loss and angular loss. The three loss functions work in a cooperative way to train a feature extraction network equipped with Residual connections and squeeze-and-excitation attention. We conduct experiments on the large-scale VoxCeleb2 dataset, which contains over a million utterances from over 6,000 speakers, and the proposed deep neural network obtains an equal error rate of 3.48%, which is a very competitive result. Codes for both training and testing and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Greatjiweix/DmmltiSV, which is the first publicly available code repository for large-scale text- independent speaker verification with performance on par with the state-of-the-art systems.

In this work, we investigate the VGG2 network as the input layer to the RNN-T in streaming speech recognition. Specifically, before the input feature is passed to the RNN-T, we introduce a gated-VGG2 block, which uses the first two layers of the VGG16 to extract contextual information in the time domain, and then use a SEnet-style gating mechanism to control what information in the channel domain is to be propagated to RNN-T. The results show that the RNN-T model with the proposed gated-VGG2 block brings significant performance improvement when compared to the existing RNN-T model, and it has a lower latency and character error rate than the Transformer-based model.","[Wang, Xintong] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Sci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chuangang] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,"Zhao, CA (通讯作者)，Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",xintongwang@bjfu.edu.cn; zhaochuangang@bjfu.edu.cn,,"Wang, Xintong/0000-0002-3702-2380",,,,,32,1,1,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2078-2489,,INFORMATION,Information,APR,2021.0,12,4,,,,,,,165,10.3390/info12040165,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info12040165,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,RR4MB,,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000643073300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

CNNs can effectively extract the locality and correlation of input data using structures in which convolutional layers are successively applied to the input data. In general, the performance of neural networks has improved as the depth of CNNs has increased. However, an increase in the depth of a CNN is not always accompanied by an increase in the accuracy of the neural network. This is because the gradient vanishing problem may arise, causing the weights of the weighted layers to fail to converge.

However, a key part of caricatures, face warping, has remained challenging for these systems. In this work, we propose AutoToon, the first supervised deep learning method that yields high-quality warps for the warping component of caricatures. Completely disentangled from style, it can be paired with any stylization method to create diverse caricatures. In contrast to prior art, we leverage an SENet and spatial transformer module and train directly on artist warping fields, applying losses both prior to and after warping.

The approximation is based on Courtois' decomposition/aggregation techniques and is applied to Senet hybrid multiplexing, movable boundary frame allocation schemes. The approximation is applied to both infinite and finite buffer systems. In the former case the approximation is valid only in the underload region and serves as an upperbound for the mean data queuing delay. In the finite buffer case it is valid for the whole data traffic range and is shown to improve as the number of channels increase, and deteriorates as the buffer size increases. For finite buffer systems upper and lower bounds for the decomposition approximation have also been derived. It is found that the lower bound is tight in the underload and low traffic region of the overload. In these same regions the decomposition approximation serves as a tight upperbound.","COLUMBIA UNIV,DEPT ELECT ENGN,NEW YORK,NY 10027; COLUMBIA UNIV,CTR TELECOMMUN RES,NEW YORK,NY 10027",,"GHANI, S (通讯作者)，NYNEX SCI & TECHNOL INC,TECH STAFF,WHITE PLAINS,NY 10604, USA.",,,,,,,,11,43,46,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2394",0090-6778,,,IEEE T COMMUN,IEEE Trans.

To make CNNs more efficient, dynamic neural networks (DyNet) have been proposed to increase the complexity of the model by using the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module to adaptively obtain the importance of each convolution kernel through the attention mechanism. However, the attention mechanism in the SE network (SENet) selects all channel information for calculations, which brings essential challenges: (a) interference caused by the internal redundant information; and (b) increasing number of network calculations. To address the above problems, this work proposes a dynamic convolutional network (termed as EAM-DyNet) to reduce the number of channels in feature maps by extracting only the useful spatial information. EAM-DyNet first uses the random channel reduction and channel grouping reduction methods to remove the redundancy in the information. As the downsampling of information can lead to the loss of useful information, it then applies an adaptive average pooling method to maintain the information integrity. Extensive experimental results on the baseline demonstrate that EAM-DyNet outperformed the existing approaches, thus it can achieve higher accuracy of the network test and less network parameters.","[Ding, Enjie; Cheng, Yuhao; Xiao, Chengcheng; Liu, Zhongyu] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Informat & Control Engn, Xuzhou 221008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ding, Enjie; Cheng, Yuhao; Xiao, Chengcheng; Liu, Zhongyu] China Univ Min & Technol, IOT Percept Mine Res Ctr, Xuzhou 221008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Wanli] Univ Bremen, Inst Electrodynam & Microelect, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",,"Liu, ZY (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Informat & Control Engn, Xuzhou 221008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Liu, ZY (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol, IOT Percept Mine Res Ctr, Xuzhou 221008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",enjied@cumt.edu.cn; TS19060020A31@cumt.edu.cn; TS2006055A31@cumt.edu.cn; TB17060009B4@cumt.edu.cn; wyu@uni-bremen.de,,,"Research on On-line identification of Coal Gangue Based on terahertz detection technology [52074273]; State Key Research Development Program of China [2017 YFC0804400, 2017YFC0804401]",Research on On-line identification of Coal Gangue Based on terahertz detection technology; State Key Research Development Program of China(State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China),"This research was funded by Research on On-line identification of Coal Gangue Based on terahertz detection technology (grant number NO.52074273), and by the State Key Research Development Program of China (grant number NO. 2017 YFC0804400, NO. 2017YFC0804401).",,44,1,1,3,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Inspired by the remarkable performance of residual networks, we introduce a SE-Res structure which is an improved residual framework with an embedded SE unit to obtain feature maps. These maps pass through a multiscale mapping layer which can aggregate characteristics in different receptive fields. Notably, the utilization of all point-wise convolutions in the SRM-Net leads to fewer parameters for training, and the reuse of feature maps makes it more lightweight. Through extensive numerical experiments on three datasets including real hazy images, synthetic indoor and outdoor hazy images, the proposed SRM-Net achieves superior performances on subjective visual results and objective evaluation metrics compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","[Li, Yu; Yu, Wenbin; Liu, Lingya; Wang, Yiyin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Automat, Key Lab Syst Control & Informat Proc, Minist Educ China, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Ding, Lu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Automat, Key Lab Syst Control & Informat Proc, Minist Educ China, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",LY0925@sjtu.edu.cn; yuwenbin@sjtu.edu.cn; spar@sjtu.edu.cn; yiyinwang@sjtu.edu.cn; dinglu@sjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-7682-2,,,,2019.0,,,,,,,74,78,,10.1145/3376067.3376081,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3376067.3376081,,,5,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BS1ZY,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000697996900015,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we further exploit this insight by explicitly configuring each feature channel with a fine-grained learning style. We define two types of channel-wise learning styles: Refine and Represent. A Refine channel is learnt via the residual function y(i) = F-i(x) + x(i), with a regularization term on the channel response parallel to F-i(x)parallel to, aiming to refine the input feature channel x(i), of the layer. A Represent channel directly learns a new representation y(i) = H-i(x) without calculating the residual function with reference to x(i).

To discover such phonemes and quantify their effectiveness in distinguishing between spoofed and bonafide speech, we use a deep learning model with self-attention, and analyze the attention weights of the trained model.

First, we applied various convolutional neural networks to clarify the effective architecture for HAR. Afterward, we developed advanced models by embedding submodules, such as self-attention and recurrent neural networks, often adopted in recent studies. Comparative experiments on HASC, UCI, and WISDM public datasets showed that Inception-V3, which used cross-channel multi-size convolution transformation, outperformed other backbones.

We conclude that it is essential to select an appropriate backbone model before applying the submodules, and submodules are unnecessary in some cases.","[Zhao Zhongkai; Kobayashi, Satoshi; Kondo, Kazuma; Hasegawa, Tatsuhito] Univ Fukui, Grad Sch Engn, Fukui 9108507, Japan; [Koshino, Makoto] Ishikawa Coll, Natl Inst Technol, Tsubata 9290392, Japan",,"Zhao, ZK (通讯作者)，Univ Fukui, Grad Sch Engn, Fukui 9108507, Japan.",zzd21005@u-fukui.ac.jp,,"Zhao, Zhongkai/0000-0002-3344-659X; Koshino, Makoto/0000-0003-3048-6921; Kondo, Kazuma/0000-0002-8732-4758",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [19K20420],"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Early-Career Scientists under Grant 19K20420.,,52,1,1,3,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022.0,10,,,,,,20547,20558,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3152530,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3152530,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,ZM0NK,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000764063300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, this paper proposes an image super-resolution framework based on adaptive residual neural network, using the adaptive framework to switch between global and local reasoning for internal features in a flexible way, it can extract a large number of global features without neglecting key information, which is conducive to the comprehensiveness of residual images After the adaptive block, SENet is added to conduct channel modeling for the extracted features, and the importance of each feature channel is automatically acquired by learning method. Then, according to this importance, useful features are promoted and those that are not useful for the current task are suppressed.

Specifically, we utilized SeNet as backbone so as to implicitly learn to suppress irrelevant regions in an input image while highlighting salient features useful for the task. Considering the importance of multi-scales information, we proposed an improved FPN to integrate information of different scales. In order to further fuse the information from multiple scales, the Hypercolumns module was inserted at the end of the network.

Frame skipping is performed based on the Hamming distance of the hash value of every two adjacent frames in video. Noise reduction is performed on key point coordinates with the Kalman filter. To calculate the human steering angle, current state information of key points is predicted using the optimal estimation of key points at the previous time.

These methods perform local optimization with an element-wise scaling learning rate based on past gradients. Although these methods can achieve an advantageous training loss, some researchers have pointed out that their generalization capability tends to be poor as compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in many applications. These methods obtain a rapid initial training process but fail to converge to an optimal solution due to the unstable and extreme learning rates. In this paper, we investigate the adaptive gradient methods and get the insights on various factors that may lead to poor performance of Adam. To overcome that, we propose a bounded scheduling algorithm for Adam, which can not only improve the generalization capability but also ensure the convergence. To validate our claims, we carry out a series of experiments on the image classification and the language modeling tasks on several standard benchmarks such as ResNet, DenseNet, SENet and LSTM on typical data sets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Penn Treebank.

Human visual search mechanism has the characteristics of visual guidance from global to local. In order to imitate this behavior, this paper proposes a novel salient object detection model which integrates global and local perception based on visual search guidance. First, by using multi-level feature complementarity, a coarse global perceptual map can be obtained by encoding VGG network and decoding deconvolution network. Then, through the Maximally Stable External Regions (MSER) algorithm, the local hotspot sub-regions in the coarse global perceptual map are intercepted, and generating a visual guidance search path based on the maximum response principle, and the local fine perceptual map is successively merged through the Squeeze and-Excitation Networks (SENet) step by step. Finally, the salient map integrating the coarse global and fine local perception is achieved. Because only one local area needs to be integrated at a time, which is equivalent to solving a relatively simple problem at a time, it is easy to get more accurate results. The experimental results show that the time-consuming of our model is relatively low and compared with the classical and more recent SOTA methods, our model also shows competitive results.","[Zhang, Dongbo] Xiangtan Univ, Coll Automat & Elect Informat, Xiangtan, Peoples R China; Natl Engn Lab Robot Vis Percept & Control Technol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, DB (通讯作者)，Xiangtan Univ, Coll Automat & Elect Informat, Xiangtan, Peoples R China.",zhadonbo@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foun-dation of China [U19A2083]; Key Project of Guangdong Fundamen-tal and Application Fundamental Research Joint Fund [2020B15151 20050]; key scientific and technological research and major achievement transformation project of strategic emerging industries in Hunan Province [2019GK4007]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province [2020JJ4090, 2020JJ4588]",National Natural Science Foun-dation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Project of Guangdong Fundamen-tal and Application Fundamental Research Joint Fund; key scientific and technological research and major achievement transformation project of strategic emerging industries in Hunan Province; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province),"Acknowledgments This work was partly supported by National Natural Science Foun-dation of China (U19A2083) , Key Project of Guangdong Fundamen-tal and Application Fundamental Research Joint Fund (2020B15151 20050) .

PRCN is built on the two-stage residual channel separation block (RCSB) and long-skip connections. First, we divide the input into four channel groups to differently learn texture details, immediately followed by a primary fusion to establish cross-channel correspondence in the first stage. Then we perform a further fusion on the outputs of the first stage to constitute a clique for the refinement in the second stage. Meanwhile, we employ SENet to improve the outputs of the second stage with the separate features of the first stage. This design not only enforces the correlation across channels, but also allows fewer densely connected blocks.

If these systems are deployed to embedded terminals by making the model lightweight while ensuring accuracy, then the problem can be addressed. To this end, we propose a fine-grained VTC method using lightweight convolutional neural network with feature optimization and joint learning strategy. Firstly, a lightweight convolutional network with feature optimization (LWCNN-FO) is designed. We use depthwise separable convolution to reduce network parameters. Besides, the SENet module is added to obtain the important degree of each feature channel automatically through the sample-based self-learning, which can improve recognition accuracy with less network parameters growth. In addition, considering both between-class similarity and intra-class variance, this paper adopts the joint learning strategy combining softmax loss and contrastive-center loss to class vehicle types, thereby improving model's fine-grained classification ability. We also build a dataset, called Car-159, consisting of 7998 pictures for 159 vehicle types, to evaluate our method.

This short episode can be connected to the demotic cycle of Setne Khamwas, to be precise when this literary hero seizes a book of magic from a tomb after playing dice-the Egyptian senet-with the dead. These two stories share a common origin, arising possibly from the same folkloric tradition from the second half of the First Millenium B.C. But even if the adventure of Rhampsinitus is one of the many underworld motifs which occur in folklore throughout the world, it is important to note that the descent to hell is not a recurrent theme in Egyptian imagery. Here we are dealing possibly with a foreign topic, even an interpretatio graeca of the katabasis of Rhampsinitus, Herodotus being influenced by the echoes of the doctrines of the Orphics and the Pythagoreans, and trying to support the supposedly Egyptian belief in the transmigration of the soul, a clearly dubious statement.","Univ Seville, Dept Ancient Hist, Seville, Spain",,"Delgado, JMS (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Ancient Hist, Seville, Spain.",delgado@us.es,,,,,,,67,2,2,0,2,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1569-2116,,,J ANC NEAR EAST RELI,J.

However, research has yet to solve the practical problem of how to improve the recognition rate by increasing the depth of the network. The method proposed in this paper is based on the idea of a residual network, which shows that if a fast connection is added between network layers, the network will be deeper, the accuracy will be higher, and the training will be more efficient. The proposed Densely Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (DSENet) combines densely connected networks with the structure of a Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet). The proposed structure is based on layers comprising blocks of compressed networks, and DSENet enables each of these layers to connect directly to all previous layers with adaptive weights. DSENet has many advantages, such as a high utilization rate of parameters and the ability to alleviate the disappearance of a gradient. The performance of the proposed network is evaluated on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, and experiments show that DSENet achieves better results on those datasets when compared with the most popular convolutional networks in current use.","[Wu, Yu] Guangzhou Univ, Lab Ctr, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,"Wu, Y (通讯作者)，Guangzhou Univ, Lab Ctr, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",35452015@qq.com,,"Wu, Yu/0000-0002-1804-0495",Scientific Research Projects of Universities in Guangzhou of the Guangzhou Education Bureau [1201620306],Scientific Research Projects of Universities in Guangzhou of the Guangzhou Education Bureau,"This work was supported by the Scientific Research Projects of Universities in Guangzhou of the Guangzhou Education Bureau, under Grant No. 1201620306.",,21,5,6,4,19,AIP Publishing,MELVILLE,"1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",,2158-3226,,AIP ADV,AIP Adv.,JUN,2019.0,9,6,,,,,,,65016,10.1063/1.5100577,http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.5100577,,,7,"Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics,IH3ZF,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000474430700059,View Full Record in Web of Science

In industrial settings, it can free up manpower required for reading and tracking product information. However, character recognition in industrial environments is particularly challenging. The main challenges are as follows: (1) There are no publicly available datasets that would aid the development of robust industrial character recognition methods; (2) Industrial characters may be printed in complex and uneven shapes on the surface of various materials, resulting in blurred characters, low contrast and distortion; (3) Industrial character recognition in complex industrial environments can suffers from various difficulties, such as uneven lighting conditions, oxidation of characters caused by long-term storage, etc. To address these challenges, we propose a convolutional recurrent neural network based on a residual structure and a Squeeze-and-Excitation block, namely RS-CRNN. The feature extraction of this method is inspired by ResNet and SEnet, and the method uses gate recurrent units for sequence label prediction.

The application of deep learning has shown impressive performance in various application areas, particularly in image classification, segmentation and object detection. Recent advances of deep learning techniques bring encouraging performance to fine-grained image classification which aims to distinguish subordinate-level categories. This task is extremely challenging due to high intra-class and low inter-class variance. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of various deep architectures and model highlighting characteristics of particular model. Firstly, we described the functioning of CNN architectures and its components followed by detailed description of various CNN models starting with classical LeNet model to AlexNet, ZFNet, GoogleNet, VGGNet, ResNet, ResNeXt, SENet, DenseNet, Xception, PNAS/ENAS. We mainly focus on the application of deep learning architectures to three major applications, namely (i) wild animal detection, (ii) small arm detection and (iii) human being detection. A detailed review summary including the systems, database, application and accuracy claimed is also provided for each model to serve as guidelines for future work in the above application areas.","[Dhillon, Anamika; Verma, Gyanendra K.] Natl Inst Technol Kurukshetra, Dept Comp Engn, Kurukshetra 136119, Haryana, India",,"Dhillon, A (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Technol Kurukshetra, Dept Comp Engn, Kurukshetra 136119, Haryana, India.",dhillon.anamika2390@gmail.com; gyanendra@nitkkr.ac.in,"Verma, Gyanendra/A-1013-2016","Verma, Gyanendra/0000-0003-2567-3730",,,,,135,132,135,12,16,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2192-6352,2192-6360,,PROG ARTIF INTELL,Prog.

The traditional polysomnography (PSG) detection process is complicated and expensive, which has attracted researchers to explore a rapid detection method based on single-lead ECG signals. However, existing ECG-based sleep apnea detection methods have certain limitations and complexities, mainly relying on human-crafted features. To solve the problem, the paper develops a sleep apnea detection method based on a residual attention mechanism network. The method uses the RR interval signal and the R-peak signal derived from the ECG signal as input, realizes feature extraction through the residual network (ResNet), and adds the SENet attention mechanism to deepen the mining of channel features. Experimental results show that the per-segment accuracy of the proposed method can reach 86.2%. Compared with existing works, its accuracy has increased by 1.1-8.1%. These results show that the proposed residual attention network can effectively use ECG signals to quickly detect sleep apnea. Meanwhile, compared with existing works, the proposed method overcomes the limitations and complexity of human-crafted features in sleep apnea detection research.","[Wang, Tao; Lu, Changhua; Fang, Hengyang] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat, Hefei 230000, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chun] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Hefei 230000, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yining] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Intelligent Machines, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Weiwei] Hefei Univ Technol, Intelligent Interconnected Syst Lab Anhui Prov, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China",,"Wang, T (通讯作者)，Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat, Hefei 230000, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Liu, C (通讯作者)，Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Hefei 230000, Anhui, Peoples R China.",wtustc@mail.ustc.edu.cn; dqlch03@hfut.edu.cn,,"Wang, Tao/0000-0002-2926-3977",Science and Technology Service Network Initiative of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [KFJ-STS-ZDTP-079]; Intelligent Interconnected Systems Laboratory of Anhui Province [PA2021AKSK0112],Science and Technology Service Network Initiative of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Intelligent Interconnected Systems Laboratory of Anhui Province,"The work is supported by the Science and Technology Service Network Initiative of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. KFJ-STS-ZDTP-079), and Intelligent Interconnected Systems Laboratory of Anhui Province (Grant No. PA2021AKSK0112).",,32,0,0,3,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0013-5585,1862-278X,,BIOMED ENG-BIOMED TE,Biomed.

Solving the feature extraction and fault diagnosis of machinery with heavy noise is beneficial for stable industrial production. However, the local properties of CNN prevent it from obtaining global features to collect sufficient fault information, leading to the degradation of fault diagnosis performance of CNN under heavy noise. In this article, a novel framework named Convformer-NSE is developed to extract robust features that integrate both global and local information, aiming at improving the end-to-end fault diagnostic performance of gearbox under heavy noise. First, Convformer is constructed to improve the nonlinear representation of the feature map, in which the sparse modified multi self-attention is used to model the long-range dependency of the feature map while keeping attention on local features.

The essence of such initiatives is that manufacturers are able to satisfy a constantly changing demand by using flexible smart machines. However, the implementation of all the technologies used by the Industry 4.0 in production systems is not easy due to significant challenges. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and examine the challenges faced by manufacturing companies when trying to apply Industry 4.0. Occupational safety is certainly one of the most important challenges of the new production paradigm, to which adequate attention should be paid. This challenge is becoming even more pronounced in the project environment because of the temporary nature of the projects. In order to improve the level of occupational safety, its adequate analysis seems necessary. One way to do this is to compare the subject area in different contexts.

Feature learning has shown great potential for addressing this issue. However, the knowledge achieved using a simple feature fusion method is insufficient to fully represent the material images. In this study, we aimed to exploit the diverse knowledge learned by a novel progressive feature fusion method to improve the recognition performance. To obtain implicit cross-modal knowledge, we perform early feature fusion and capture the cluster canonical correlations among the state-of-the-art (SOTA) heterogeneous squeeze-and-excitation network (SENet) features. A set of more discriminative deep-level visual semantics (DVSs) is obtained. We then perform gene selection-based middle feature fusion to thoroughly exploit the feature-shared knowledge among the generated DVSs. Finally, any type of general classifier can use the feature-shared knowledge to perform the final material recognition. Experimental results on two public datasets (Fabric and MattrSet) showed that our method outperformed other SOTA baseline methods in terms of accuracy and real-time efficiency. Even most traditional classifiers were able to obtain a satisfactory performance using our method, thus demonstrating its high practicality.","[Zhang, Hongbin; Xiong, Qipeng; Shi, Haowei; Liang, Weinan; Zhong, Xiang; Zhu, Zhiliang; Li, Xiong] East China Jiaotong Univ, Sch Software, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Ji, Donghong] Wuhan Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, HB (通讯作者)，East China Jiaotong Univ, Sch Software, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",zhanghongbin@whu.edu.cn,,"zhang, hongbin/0000-0002-8375-0039; Zhiliang, Zhu/0000-0002-0939-0741","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62161011, 61762038, 61861016]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Provincial Department of Science and Technology [20202BABL202044, 20202BABL212006, 20192ACB21004]; Key Research and Development Plan of Jiangxi Provincial Science and Technology Department [20171BBG70093, 20192BBE50071, 20202BBEL53003]; Humanity and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China [20YJAZH142]; Science and Technology Projects of Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education [GJJ190323, GJJ200627, GJJ200644]; Humanity and Social Science Foundation of Jiangxi University [TQ19101, TQ20108]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Provincial Department of Science and Technology; Key Research and Development Plan of Jiangxi Provincial Science and Technology Department; Humanity and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Science and Technology Projects of Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education; Humanity and Social Science Foundation of Jiangxi University","AcknowledgmentsThis research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant numbers: 62161011, 61762038 and 61861016; the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Provincial Department of Science and Technology, grant numbers: 20202BABL202044, 20202BABL212006, and 20192ACB21004; the Key Research and Development Plan of Jiangxi Provincial Science and Technology Department, grant numbers: 20171BBG70093, 20192BBE50071, and 20202BBEL53003; the Humanity and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China, grant number: 20YJAZH142, the Science and Technology Projects of Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, grant numbers: GJJ190323, GJJ200627, and GJJ200644; and the Humanity and Social Science Foundation of Jiangxi University, grant numbers: TQ19101 and TQ20108.

In the process of UAV detection and tracking, there are common problems such as target deformation, target occlusion, and targets being submerged by complex background clutter. This paper proposes an anti-occlusion UAV tracking algorithm for low-altitude complex backgrounds by integrating an attention mechanism that mainly solves the problems of complex backgrounds and occlusion when tracking UAVs. First, extracted features are enhanced by using the SeNet attention mechanism. Second, the occlusion-sensing module is used to judge whether the target is occluded. If the target is not occluded, tracking continues. Otherwise, the LSTM trajectory prediction network is used to predict the UAV position of subsequent frames by using the UAV flight trajectory before occlusion. This study was verified on the OTB-100, GOT-10k and integrated UAV datasets. The accuracy and success rate of integrated UAV datasets were 79% and 50.5% respectively, which were 10.6% and 4.9% higher than those of the SiamCAM algorithm. Experimental results show that the algorithm could robustly track a small UAV in a low-altitude complex background.","[Wang, Chuanyun; Meng, Linlin; Gao, Qian] Shenyang Aerosp Univ, Coll Artificial Intelligence, Shenyang 110136, Peoples R China; [Shi, Zhongrui] Shenyang Aerosp Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shenyang 110136, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jingjing] China Acad Elect & Informat Technol, Beijing 100041, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tian] Beihang Univ, Inst Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ershen] Shenyang Aerosp Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Shenyang 110136, Peoples R China",,"Wang, CY (通讯作者)，Shenyang Aerosp Univ, Coll Artificial Intelligence, Shenyang 110136, Peoples R China.",wangcy0301@sau.edu.cn; shizhongrui@stu.sau.edu.cn; menglinlin@stu.sau.edu.cn; wangjingjing@cetccloud.com; wangtian@buaa.edu.cn; gaoqian@buaa.edu.cn; wes2016@sau.edu.cn,,"Wang, Chuanyun/0000-0002-6737-3472","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61703287, 62173237]; Scientific Research Program of Liaoning Provincial Education Department of China [LJKZ0218, JYT2020045]; Young and middle-aged Science and Technology Innovation Talents Project of Shenyang of China [RC210401]; Liaoning Provincial Key R&D Program of China [2020JH2/10100045]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Program of Liaoning Provincial Education Department of China; Young and middle-aged Science and Technology Innovation Talents Project of Shenyang of China; Liaoning Provincial Key R&D Program of China,"This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China with grant Nos. 61703287 and 62173237, Scientific Research Program of Liaoning Provincial Education Department of China with grant Nos.

However, the conventional detection of AF is time-consuming and laborious because it is mainly completed by physician's visual inspection of electrocardiogram (ECG). Thus, it is essential to build the intelligent computer-aided diagnosis system strategy for AF detection. In this work, we present a novel intelligent approach based on the multi-scale convolution kernel (MCK) and Squeeze-and-Excitation network (SENet) for AF detection. The model not only is able to overcome the limitations that exist in the single-scale convolution kernel of traditional convolution neural network (CNN), but also explicitly establish the inter-dependences between the extracted feature channels and screen out the critical ECG features for AF signals recognition, thus improving the model performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves noticeable performance improvements with the accuracy of 98.3% and 97.5% using a subject-independent validation scheme on the two public databases. Besides, the corresponding ablation experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed MCK strategy. To our knowledge, this is the first time to redesign the convolution kernel in traditional CNN for AF detection, while showing its great potential as an auxiliary tool to help physicians.","[Guo, Xibin] Zhengzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Elect & Elect Engn, Zhengzhou 450064, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qiao; Zheng, Jinfeng] Henan Univ Technol, Coll Elect Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China",,"Wang, Q (通讯作者)，Henan Univ Technol, Coll Elect Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.",wqiao20202020@163.com,,,Science and Technology Project of Henan Province of China [182102210137],Science and Technology Project of Henan Province of China,This work was supported in part by the Science and Technology Project of Henan Province of China under Grant No. 182102210137.,,39,2,2,3,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1746-8094,1746-8108,,BIOMED SIGNAL PROCES,Biomed.

This paper proposes a novel variance loss function based on a ground truth mask of the target object to enhance the visual attention of a CNN. The loss function regularizes the training process so that the feature maps in the later convolutional layer are focused more on target object areas and less on the background. Attention loss is computed directly from the feature maps, so no new parameters are added to the backbone network; therefore, no extra computational cost is added to the testing phase. The proposed attention model can be a plug-in for any pre-trained network architecture and can be used in conjunction with other attention models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed variance loss function improves classification accuracy by 2.22% over the baseline on the Stanford Dogs dataset, which is significantly higher than the improvements achieved by SENet (0.3%) and CBAM (1.14%). Our method also improves object detection accuracy by 2.5 mAP on the Pascal-VOC2007 dataset and store sign detection by 2.66 mAP over respective baseline models.

Telecommunications are an integral part of the global communications network; they are critical for organizations as well as for individuals and have socio-economic value. Large telecommunication companies are doing business in an environment where there is a discrepancy between the need for the introduction of innovations into the portfolio of services and the traditional methods of service development, as well as their market placement. With the expansion of the internet in the industry, the ways of distribution and consumption of digital services have changed considerably. Taking into consideration the increasing complexity of regulations and the environment in which projects that support the development of ICT products and services are led, the right choice of project management methodology is becoming more important. Alongside with the usage of traditional approaches to project management, there is a development of new methodologies through the introduction of dynamic models for achieving project results more quickly. This thesis is based on research conducted on a telecommunications company representative in the region, with the assumption that the introduction of agile methodologies can achieve competitiveness in the highly competitive market of modern telecommunications services. The presented results are based on research conducted in the large telecommunications company, with an emphasis on the recognition of requirements for the introduction of different project management methodologies in the service development process. Based on surveys of management and employees of the company that is involved in the process of service development, test and agile management have been introduced along with the existing traditional management. This paper shows a comparison between these two methodologies on one project which includes the introduction of an innovative ICT service. Based on the results, the hypothesis which assumes that the introduction of agile management provides competitiveness on the market of telecommunications services has been confirmed.","[Milenkovic, Mila] Telekom Srbija, Digital Innovat & Applicat Dept, Belgrade, Serbia; [Lalic, Bojan] Fac Tech Sci, Dept Ind Engn & Engn Management, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Pavlovic, Katarina; Beric, Ivana; Sobajic, Vesna] Fac Project & Innovat Management, Project Management Dept, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Milenkovic, M (通讯作者)，Telekom Srbija, Digital Innovat & Applicat Dept, Belgrade, Serbia.",mila@telekom.rs; blalic@uns.ac.rs; katarina.pavlovic@pmc.edu.rs; ivana.beric@pmc.edu.rs; vesna.sobajic@pmc.edu.rs,"Lalic, Bojan/AAC-4625-2021",,,,,,29,0,0,0,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-861-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2019.0,108,,,,,,39,48,,,,,,10,Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP1JP,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000539503700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unlike existing works that designed CNN architectures to improve performance on a single task of a single domain and not generalizable, we present IBN-Net, a novel convolutional architecture, which remarkably enhances a CNN's modeling ability on one domain (e.g. Cityscapes) as well as its generalization capacity on another domain (e.g. GTA5) without finetuning. IBN-Net carefully integrates Instance Normalization (IN) and Batch Normalization (BN) as building blocks, and can be wrapped into many advanced deep networks to improve their performances. This work has three key contributions. (1) By delving into IN and BN, we disclose that IN learns features that are invariant to appearance changes, such as colors, styles, and virtuality/reality, while BN is essential for preserving content related information. (2) IBN-Net can be applied to many advanced deep architectures, such as DenseNet, ResNet, ResNeXt, and SENet, and consistently improve their performance without increasing computational cost. (3) When applying the trained networks to new domains, e.g. from GTA5 to Cityscapes, IBN-Net achieves comparable improvements as domain adaptation methods, even without using data from the target domain.

For the purpose of reducing monitoring costs and building health risk assessment models, a new deep learning forecasting model based on empirical mode decomposition, long short-term memory (LSTM) block and squeeze and excitation networks (SENet) is proposed. To begin, the original PM2.5 data is decomposed into multiple sub-series with varying frequencies using empirical mode decomposition. Then, an LSTM neural network is built to forecast the new sub series. Finally, squeeze and excitation networks were constructed and coupled to automatically pick informative weights to obtain the real-time forecasting result. The proposed model is compared to other commonly used models such as convolutional neural network and LSTM for its ability to forecast PM2.5 on an hourly experiment. The proposed model outperforms reference models in terms of forecasting performance, owing to its ability to capture informative characteristics and temporal patterns from varying PM2.5 dataset. The mean square error is improved by 38.29% and 29.21% compared with convolutional neural network and LSTM, respectively. When compared to convolutional neural networks and LSTM, the mean absolute error is reduced by 22.93% and 13.38%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed model also performs best in health risk warning assessment.","[Yang, Duanwu; Wang, Jinyong; Liu, Hongbin] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Jiangsu Coinnovat Ctr Efficient Proc & Utilizat Fo, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongbin] Guangxi Univ, Coll Light Ind & Food Engn, Guangxi Key Lab Clean Pulp & Papermaking & Pollut, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China; [Yan, Xiaoan] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Sch Mechatron Engn, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongbin] Shandong Huatai Paper Co Ltd, Lab Comprehens Utilizat Paper Waste Shandong Prov, Dongying 257335, Peoples R China",,"Liu, HB (通讯作者)，Nanjing Forestry Univ, Jiangsu Coinnovat Ctr Efficient Proc & Utilizat Fo, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China.;Liu, HB (通讯作者)，Guangxi Univ, Coll Light Ind & Food Engn, Guangxi Key Lab Clean Pulp & Papermaking & Pollut, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China.",hongbinliu@njfu.edu.cn,,,"Opening Project of Guangxi Key Labo-ratory of Clean Pulp & Papermaking and Pollution Control, China [2021KF11]; Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China [ZR2021MF135]","Opening Project of Guangxi Key Labo-ratory of Clean Pulp & Papermaking and Pollution Control, China; Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province)","This work was supported by Opening Project of Guangxi Key Labo-ratory of Clean Pulp & Papermaking and Pollution Control, China (2021KF11) and Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China (ZR2021MF135) .",,38,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0957-5820,1744-3598,,PROCESS SAF ENVIRON,Process Saf.

The challenge comes with two tasks. For task 1, skin lesions have to be classified based on dermoscopic images. For task 2, dermoscopic images and additional patient meta data are used. Our deep learning-based method achieved first place for both tasks. The are several problems we address with our method. First, there is an unknown class in the test set which we cover with a data-driven approach. Second, there is a severe class imbalance that we address with loss balancing. Third, there are images with different resolutions which motivates two different cropping strategies and multi-crop evaluation. Last, there is patient meta data available which we incorporate with a dense neural network branch. We address skin lesion classification with an ensemble of deep learning models including EfficientNets, SENet, and ResNeXt WSL, selected by a search strategy. We rely on multiple model input resolutions and employ two cropping strategies for training. We counter severe class imbalance with a loss balancing approach.

It is critical to develop stringent inspection and quarantine protocols with active management to control the import and export accompanied by exotic seeds. As a result, a method for promptly identifying exotic plant seeds is urgently needed. In this study, we built a database containing 3000 images of seeds of 12 invasive plants and proposed an improved YOLOv5 target detection algorithm that incorporates a channel attention mechanism. Given that certain seeds in the same family and genus are very similar in appearance and are thus difficult to differentiate, we improved the size model of the initial anchor box to converge better; moreover, we introduce three attention modules, SENet, CBAM, and ECA-Net, to enhance the extraction of globally important features while suppressing the weakening of irrelevant features, thereby effectively solving the problem of automated inspection of similar species. Experiments on an invasive alien plant seed data set reveal that the improved network model fused with ECA-Net requires only a small increase in parameters when compared to the original YOLOv5 network model and achieved greater classification and detection accuracy without affecting detection speed.","[Yang, Lianghai; Yan, Jing; Li, Huiru; Cao, Xinyue; Ge, Binjie; Yan, Xiaoling] Shanghai Chenshan Bot Garden, Eastern China Conservat Ctr Wild Endangered Plant, Shanghai 201602, Peoples R China; [Yang, Lianghai; Qi, Zhechen] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Secondary Metab & Reg, Coll Life Sci & Med, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Qi, Zhechen] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Shaoxing Acad Biomed, Shaoxing 312366, Peoples R China",,"Yan, XL (通讯作者)，Shanghai Chenshan Bot Garden, Eastern China Conservat Ctr Wild Endangered Plant, Shanghai 201602, Peoples R China.;Qi, ZC (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Plant Secondary Metab & Reg, Coll Life Sci & Med, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.;Qi, ZC (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Shaoxing Acad Biomed, Shaoxing 312366, Peoples R China.",15150595752@163.com; yan.jing01@163.com; wwwlihuiru@163.com; caoxinyue0417@163.com; gebinjie@csnbgsh.cn; zqi@zstu.edu.cn; xlyan@cemps.ac.cn,,,"Special Fund for Scientific Research of Shanghai Landscaping & City Appearance Administrative Bureau [G212405, G222403, ZWGX1902]; Special Fundamental Work of the Ministry of Science and Technology [2014FY120400]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY21C030008]; Open Fund of Shaoxing Academy of Biomedicine of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University [SXAB202020]",Special Fund for Scientific Research of Shanghai Landscaping & City Appearance Administrative Bureau; Special Fundamental Work of the Ministry of Science and Technology; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Open Fund of Shaoxing Academy of Biomedicine of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University,"This research was funded by the Special Fund for Scientific Research of Shanghai Landscaping & City Appearance Administrative Bureau, grant numbers G212405, G222403; National Wild Plant Germplasm Resource Center, grant number ZWGX1902; Special Fundamental Work of the Ministry of Science and Technology, grant number 2014FY120400; the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, grant number LY21C030008; and the Open Fund of Shaoxing Academy of Biomedicine of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, grant number SXAB202020.",,30,1,1,43,43,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-2818,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,APR,2022.0,14,4,,,,,,,254,10.3390/d14040254,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14040254,,,18,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,0U1JP,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000787413800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is a known fact for every project management professional that most common challenges are the completion of project on time, scope changes, goals, unplanned risks, engagement on several different projects, lack of competencies, lack of top management and stakeholder engagement, economic instability, legal barriers and many others. Through literature search, it was observed that there are no data related to challenges project managers face in Serbia, and for this reason, the aim of this paper is to provide this information, based on a study conducted. Challenges presented in the survey are most widely and statistically recognized ones as globally present, and the idea was to show how these challenges fit into contemporary project management practice in Serbia and to show the difference between small and large companies. The research part of the paper was based on a survey, presented to project managers in project management practising organizations in Serbia, large majority of which being from a service sector. Through this survey four hypotheses were tested. Methods of descriptive and analytical statistics were used for evaluation of the survey, and all four hypotheses were confirmed. Major challenges for project managers in Serbia were identified, and it was shown that the size of a company does have an impact on dealing with challenges.

The standard convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully applied in the SAR image recognition due to its powerful feature extraction capability. Nevertheless, the CNN requires numerous labeled samples for satisfactory recognition performance, while the performance of the CNN decreases greatly with insufficient labeled samples. Aiming at improving the SAR image recognition accuracy with a small number of labeled samples, a new few-shot learning method is proposed in this paper. We first utilize the attention prototypical network (APN) to calculate the average features of the support images from each category, which are adopted as the prototypes. Afterwards, the feature extraction is performed on the query images using the attention convolutional neural network (ACNN). Finally, the feature matching classifier (FMC) is adopted for calculating the similarity scores between the feature maps and the prototypes. We embed the attention model SENet to the APN, ACNN, and FMC, which effectively enhances the expression of the prototypes and the feature maps. Besides, the loss function of our method consists of cross-entropy and prototype-separability losses. In the training process, this loss function increases the separability of different prototypes, which contributes to higher recognition accuracy. We perform experiments on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) and the Vehicle and Aircraft (VA) datasets. It has been proved that our method is superior to the related state-of-the-art few-shot image recognition methods. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The rapid progress of deep learning has contributed to the promotion of this technology with automatic feature extraction, a broader scope of application, and stronger expansibility. An image recognition method of wind turbine blade defects using attention-based MobileNetv1-YOLOv4 and transfer learning is proposed in this paper. The backbone convolution neural network of YOLOv4 is replaced by the lightweight MobileNetv1 for feature extraction to reduce complexity and computation. Attention-based feature refinement with three distinctive modules, SENet, ECANet, and CBAM, is introduced to realize adaptive feature optimization. To solve the problem of slow network convergence and low detection accuracy caused by insufficient data, a two-stage transfer learning approach is introduced to fine-tune the pre-trained network. Comparative experiments verify the efficacy of the proposed model, with higher detection accuracy but a significantly faster response speed and less computational complexity, compared with other state-of-the-art networks by using images of the wind turbine blades taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

In this work, we start from a different view and regard the channel representation problem as a compression process using frequency analysis. Based on the frequency analysis, we mathematically prove that the conventional global average pooling is a special case of the feature decomposition in the frequency domain. With the proof, we naturally generalize the compression of the channel attention mechanism in the frequency domain and propose our method with multi-spectral channel attention, termed as FcaNet. FcaNet is simple but effective. We can change a few lines of code in the calculation to implement our method within existing channel attention methods. Moreover, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results compared with other channel attention methods on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.

This new segmentation structure can greatly improve the segmentation performance of the ROIs in the brain as compared with the classical convolutional neural network (CNN), which yields a Dice coefficient of 0.8920. In the second stage, MBCs are used to train neural network regression models for enhanced nonlinearity.

However, many of the latest network design methods, which usually deploy ResNet or SENet as the backbone network, were originally designed for classification tasks. Since the person re-identification task is essentially different from the classification task, the structure of the backbone network should be modified accordingly. In this paper, we propose a retrieval network based on a multi-scale backbone architecture, which is specifically suitable for the person re-identification task. By constructing hierarchical residual-like connections within a single residual block, the model learns multi-scale discriminative features of pedestrian images. Unlike many state-of-the-art methods that use complex network structures and concatenate multi-branch features, our proposed retrieval network is implemented using only global features, simple triplet loss, and softmax with cross-entropy loss. The results of extensive experiments show that the proposed network has stronger fine-grained pedestrian representation ability, leading to performance gains for person re-identification tasks. Our proposed network achieves a rank-1 accuracy of 96.03% on the Market-1501 and 92.11% on DukeMTMC-reID datasets while only using global features.","[Cao, Zongjing; Lee, Hyo Jong] Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Jeonju 54896, South Korea; [Lee, Hyo Jong] Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Ctr Adv Image & Informat Technol, Jeonju 54896, South Korea",,"Lee, HJ (通讯作者)，Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Jeonju 54896, South Korea.;Lee, HJ (通讯作者)，Jeonbuk Natl Univ, Ctr Adv Image & Informat Technol, Jeonju 54896, South Korea.",hlee@jbnu.ac.kr,,"Lee, Hyo Jong/0000-0003-2581-5268; /0000-0001-9715-0619",National Research Foundation of Korea through the Basic Science Research Program - Ministry of Education [GR 2019R1D1A3A03103736],"National Research Foundation of Korea through the Basic Science Research Program - Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea)",This was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea through the Basic Science Research Program funded by the Ministry of Education under Grant GR 2019R1D1A3A03103736.,,52,2,2,2,9,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020.0,8,,,,,,184644,184655,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029594,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029594,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,OI8VR,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000583549600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the signal encoding methods of the current popular channel attention mechanisms are limited. For example, SENet uses the full-connection method to encode channel relevance, which is parameters-costly; ECANet uses 1D-Convolution to encode channel relevance, which is parameter fewer but can only encode per k adjacent channels in a fixed scale. This paper proposes a novel dilated efficient channel attention module(DECA), which consists of a novel multi-scale channel encoding method and a novel channel relevance feature fusion method. We empirically show that different scale channel relevance also contributes to performance, and fusing various scale channel relevance features can obtain more powerful channel feature representation. Besides, we widely use the weight-sharing method in the DECA module to make it more efficient. Specifically, we have applied our module to the real-life fire image detection task to evaluate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments on different backbone depths, detectors, and fire datasets have shown that the average performance boost of DECA module is more than 4.5% compare to the baselines. Meanwhile, DECA outperforms other state-of-art attention modules while keeping lower or comparable parameters in the experiments.

The proposed method extracts raw features from the multivariate Gaussian in the transform domain of Gabor wavelet and uses WPCA to get robust features. Because the space of Gaussian is a Riemannian manifold, it is difficult to incorporate the learning mechanism into the model. To address this issue, Log-Euclidean approach is used to embed the multivariate Gaussian into the linear space, and then use WPCA to learn discriminative face features. LGLG-WPCA is good at extracting the detail features of face image. Furthermore, another outstanding advantage of LGLG is that its features can be effectively integrated with the high-level features of deep learning network for face recognition in more complex environments. We presented the feature fusing approaches for face recognition based on Self-attention Network (SAN) and achieved obvious performance improvement to the-state-of-the-art deep networks including SENet and FaceNet. Experiments show the proposed method is robust under adverse conditions such as varying poses, skin aging and uneven illumination, and it is suitable for face image under small-scale datasets in complex environments, such as network-based or video-based person searching or tracking.

On the one hand, the FiBiNET can dynamically learn the importance of features via the Squeeze-Excitation network (SENET) mechanism; on the other hand, it is able to effectively learn the feature interactions via bilinear function. We conduct extensive experiments on two real world datasets and show that our shallow model outperforms other shallow models such as factorization machine(FM) and field-aware factorization machine(FFM).

This study proposed an improved YOLOv4 model called YOLO-PEFL model for accurate pear flower detection in the natural environment. Pear flower targets were artificially synthesized with pear flower's surface features. The synthetic pear flower targets and the backgrounds of the original pear flower images were used as the inputs of the YOLO-PEFL model. ShuffleNetv2 embedded by the SENet (Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks) module replacing the original backbone network of the YOLOv4 model formed the backbone of the YOLO-PEFL model. The parameters of the YOLO-PEFL model were fine-tuned to change the size of the initial anchor frame. The experimental results showed that the average precision of the YOLO-PEFL model was 96.71%, the model size was reduced by about 80%, and the average detection speed was 0.027s. Compared with the YOLOv4 model and the YOLOv4-tiny model, the YOLO-PEFL model had better performance in model size, detection accuracy, and detection speed, which effectively reduced the model deployment cost and improved the model efficiency. It implied the proposed YOLO-PEFL model could accurately detect pear flowers with high efficiency in the natural environment.","[Wang, Chenglin; Zhang, Zhaoguo] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Modern Agr Engn, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chenglin; Wang, Yawei; Liu, Suchwen; Zhou, Yi] Chongqing Univ Arts & Sci, Coll Intelligent Mfg Engn, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Lin, Guichao] Zhongkai Univ Agr & Engn, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [He, Peng] Taizhou Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Taizhou, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, ZG (通讯作者)，Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Modern Agr Engn, Kunming, Peoples R China.;Lin, GC (通讯作者)，Zhongkai Univ Agr & Engn, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",guichaolin@126.com; zhaoguozhang@163.com,"Wang, Yawei/GRY-1842-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [52005069, 32101632]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020M683379]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),Funding This research has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52005069 and 32101632) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M683379).,,42,0,0,20,20,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

Most existing channel attention networks are proposed based on Squeeze- and-Excitation Networks (SENet),which can obtain excellent performance by designing complex structures, however, they also has more additional network parameters and higher floating point operations per second (FLOPs). We propose a novel lightweight attention structure called Dual Channel Attention Networks (DCA-Net). By introducing the channel attention preprocessing module and using 1D convolution with K=1, DCA-Net has a more straightforward and delicate structure. We add DCA-Net to ResNet and perform image classification experiments on CIFAR-100 dataset, object detection and instance segmentation experiments on MS-COCO dataset. Experimental results show that our DCA-Net achieves better results than the existing attention networks, such as SE-Net, ECA-Net and so on. For example, in the image classification task on CIFAR-100, the parameter amount of DCA-Net using ResNet-50 decreases by 50.03% compared to SE-Net using ResNet-101, and decreases by 44.48%compared to ECA-Net using ResNet-101, GFLOPs decreased by 48.41% and 48.21%, respectively. At the same time, the Top-1 accuracy of DCA-Net using ResNet-50 is 0.3% higher than that of SE-Net using ResNet-101, and 0.86% higher than that of ECA-Net using ResNet-101.","[Bian, Jingchen; Liu, Yugui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Bian, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",bianjingchen17@mails.ucas.ac.cn,,,,,,,22,0,0,2,10,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2020.0,1642,,,,,,,,12004,10.1088/1742-6596/1642/1/012004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1642/1/012004,,,9,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BR0TW,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000630893700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The research uses as its case study the work of the Manchester Museum Education Service with children at Key Stage Level 2 (9-11 years old) of the National Curriculum, The particular learning situation is based on senet, an ancient Egyptian board game from the Museum's collection of artefacts from the pyramid builders' town of Kahun. Results are presented of the first phase prototype, a single display groupware system where interactions take place face-to-face in the 'real-world' external to the environment. Results are also presented of the second phase prototype, a multi-user groupware environment in which the users are remotely located and interaction is mainly internal to the environment.

However, most of these methods are designed for noise-free images. The scene classification performance for noisy RS images, i.e., synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with speckle noise, is poor due to the sufficient effect of noise. An intuitive solution is denoising first and then classifying the image, which makes the whole process cumbersome. To address this problem, we design a new complete frequency channel attention network (CFCANet) that can handle noisy RS images directly without any filtering operation. CFCANet selects part of the low-frequency information to interact with the feature map adequately. For the original feature map, a corresponding 2-D discrete cosine transformation frequency component is assigned, from which the most significant eigenvalue of each channel is obtained by maximization. Compared with the frequency channel attention network (FcaNet), the proposed network has better antinoise ability as it exploits low frequency information of the images. The effectiveness of our method has been proved by experiments based on public datasets and some simulated datasets. Moreover, we build a new SAR scene classification dataset: WHU-SAR6. The comprehensive evaluation shows that the proposed method consistently outperforms several advanced methods, including ResNet, SENet, CBAM, EcaNet, and FcaNet.","[Su, Bo; Su, Xin] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jun; Luo, Bin] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qing] Air Force Res Inst, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China",,"Su, X (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",bosu.rs@whu.edu.cn; liujunand@whu.edu.cn; xinsu.rs@whu.edu.cn; luob@whu.edu.cn; wangqing_rs@pku.edu.cn,,"Luo, Bin/0000-0002-3040-3500","Chang'an University (Xi'an, China) through the National Key Research Development Program of China [2020YFC1512000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41901302]; Excellent Youth Foundation of Hubei Scientific Committee [2020CFA051]","Chang'an University (Xi'an, China) through the National Key Research Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Excellent Youth Foundation of Hubei Scientific Committee","This work was supported in part by Chang'an University (Xi'an, China) through the National Key Research Development Program of China under Grant 2020YFC1512000, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61801332, in part by the Excellent Youth Foundation of Hubei Scientific Committee under Grant 2020CFA051, and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41901302.",,65,1,1,9,18,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1939-1404,2151-1535,,IEEE J-STARS,IEEE J.

DL lies in image-based detection and instance segmentation of an entity, which is a critical issue that needs further investigation. This paper aims to study the fundamental challenges in using object instance segmentation of images. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for multi-object image instance segmentation algorithm in three stages. A novel backbone approach improves the image recognition algorithm by extracting low and high characteristic levels from the given images in the first stage. The ResNet is the fundamental building block and connects with the Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet) for each ResNet block. The Region Proposal Network (RPN) is used to determine the object item's placement, followed by the third stage, which suggests an average position RoI layer to choose the optimal boundaries of the instance segmentation. The experiments are conducted and validated using a standard benchmark image dataset, called COCO. The proposed algorithm's performance is validated using standard evaluation criteria and compared against the recent image segmentation algorithms that use object instances. The results show that the proposed algorithm gets better results than other well-known instance segmentation algorithms in terms of average accuracy over IoU (AP) threshold measures using various thresholds.","[Abuowaida, Suhaila Farhan Ahmad; Chan, Huah Yong; Alshdaifat, Nawaf Farhan Funkur] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia; [Abualigah, Laith] Amman Arab Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Informat, Amman 11953, Jordan",,"Abuowaida, SFA (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Comp Sci, George Town 11800, Malaysia.",suhailaowida@student@usm.my; hychan@usm.my; nawaf@student@usm.my; Aligah.2020@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,5,5,0,0,Princess Sumaya Univ & SRSF,Amman,"Princess Sumaya University for Technology (PSUT), Khalil Saket Street 118, Amman, JORDAN",2413-9351,2415-1076,,JORDAN J COMPUT INFO,Jordanian J.

Firstly, we collect 4M name list and download 260M faces from the Internet. Then, a Cleaning Automatically utilizing Self-Training (CAST) pipeline is devised to purify the tremendous WebFace260M, which is efficient and scalable.

Referring to practical scenarios, Face Recognition Under Inference Time conStraint (FRUITS) protocol and a test set are constructed to comprehensively evaluate face matchers. Equipped with this benchmark, we delve into million-scale face recognition problems.

One of the major elements of the sustainability of urban ambience entities and preservation of social, architectural and urban values is lighting phenomenon. Its significance is reflected in the aesthetic, as well as the functional qualities of safety and amenity for users. Usually, keeping the traditional types of luminaries (i.e. lanterns) in order to preserve ambience values lies in contradiction with the contemporary requirements, mostly because of the obsolete structural support which normally yields the application of the obsolete lighting technology. On the other hand, the introduction of contemporary luminaries in the urban areas of cultural and historical significance is often undesirable. Thus, the issue of sustainability of the historical urban ambiance entities in the context of the application of the contemporary lighting technical solutions is presented in this paper from the point of view of a project-oriented small organization, which holds in core business the philosophy of the confirmation of the existing lighting fittings to the users' space. This paper proposes and confirms business model which assures preservation of architectural ambient, with added value of the energy efficiency, functionality, life cycle savings, safety and amenity for the users, through the case study of Park vojvode Bojovica in Belgrade, Serbia by experimental collecting of model inputs, whereas the obtained results are verified by means of numeric simulation.

However, due to the high diversity of scale and shape of scene text in real world, most of the existing state-of-art algorithms may have their shortages. On the one hand, object detection based methods require quadrangle bounding box which cannot detect arbitrary text. On the other hand, the segmentation based methods fail to pay attention to the feature and channel inter-dependency, which may fall short when facing different scale texts. The Progressive Scale Expansion Network (PSENet), which can precisely detect text instances with arbitrary shapes, could be a useful and simple baseline. Based on PSENet, we additionally add more aggregation in spatial and channel of the feature map, making it possible to fully utilize feature of different scales and channels to handle arbitrary-shaped and multi-scale text instances. To accomplish this goal, we introduce the Path Aggregation Module(PAM) and Feature Selective Module(FSM). In the PAM, we implement cascade FPN structure and shortcut procedure with global information. In the FSM, we borrow the idea from SENet. Extensive experiments on Total-Text, ICDAR 2015 and ICDAR 2017 MLT validate the effectiveness of our method.

However, the supervised detection algorithm based on deep learning can only detect the known and blank material areas. Therefore, this paper proposed a phased material detection. The first stage is to detect the tray and then identify the material area in the second stage. In order to improve the tray detection accuracy during the first stage under the condition of a high intersection ratio, an improved YOLOv5s tray detection method is proposed. The structure of YOLOv5s is improved using the SENet. This paper proposes to use the rich geometric information of the shallow network and the high-level semantic information to integrate the bypass features. MAP@0.5:0.95 of the improved model increased from 95.7% to 96.6% and MAP@0.95 from 78.5% to 90.8%. The challenge of detecting unknown wrong materials on a tray can be resolved through the recognition of material area segmentation images processed by using the improved pre-detection algorithm, together with the relative position reference between the material area and the tray. The experimental results showed that the improved method proposed meets the industrial detection requirements with an overall recognition accuracy of 91% within a 250 ms detection interval.","[Hu, Dunli; Zhang, Yuting; Zhang, Xiaoping] North China Univ Technol, Beijing Key Lab Fieldbus Technol & Automat, Beijing 100144, Peoples R China; [Xufeng, Li] Shanxi Prov Peoples Hosp, Informat Management Off, Shanxi Prov Peoples Hosp, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, YT (通讯作者)，North China Univ Technol, Beijing Key Lab Fieldbus Technol & Automat, Beijing 100144, Peoples R China.",2019312110116@mail.ncut.edu.cn,,"Yuting, Zhang/0000-0002-4528-660X",Beijing Natural Science Foundation [4204096]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61903006],Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Beijing Natural Science Foundation, Award/Grant Number: 4204096; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Award/Grant Number: 61903006",,27,1,1,3,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1751-9659,1751-9667,,IET IMAGE PROCESS,IET Image Process.,NOV,2021.0,15,13,,,,,3400,3409,,10.1049/ipr2.12302,http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/ipr2.12302,,JUL 2021,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,WA8TV,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000669116000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, human errors are inevitable due to multiple reasons, such as fatigue, stress, heavy workload, lack of effective verification measures, mismanagement. Such human errors pose serious safety and health concerns on the part of patients and may as well lead to a series of medical disputes. Based on induced deep learning, this paper proposes a real-time Blister Package Identification System (BPIS) to assist pharmacists' drug verification and dispensing. Under the guidance of the induction strategy, image preprocessing is introduced to form a standardized image containing the front and back side of the blister package, which is subsequently sent to CNN-based object identification network for feature extraction and identification. This preprocessing method allows the identification system to promote the deep learning system to focus on feature learning to obtain more information about the appearance of the package ruling out confounding factors such as background noise, size, shape or positioning. In addition, this article collects and establishes an image dataset of adult lozenges. Under this dataset, this paper verifies the enhancement of Induced Deep Learning (IDL) on YOLO v2, ResNet, and SENet. By optimizing the deep learning identification network with the help of the embedded technology and a two-side extraction mechanism, a real-time BPIS is built. Long-term tests in hospitals prove the effectiveness of the proposed system.","[Han, Yun] Neijiang Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Neijiang 641100, Peoples R China; [Chung, Sheng-Luen; Wang, Jing-Syuan; Su, Shun-Feng] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Taipei 10607, Taiwan; [Xiao, Qiang] Neijiang Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Neijiang 641100, Peoples R China",,"Han, Y (通讯作者)，Neijiang Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Neijiang 641100, Peoples R China.",han198010@163.com,,"xiao, qiang/0000-0001-7977-5279",,,,,36,1,1,5,12,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021.0,9,,,,,,101344,101356,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097181,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097181,,,13,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,TQ5GU,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000678309400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Models with rigorous performance might suffer from enormous parameters and large-scale structure, and it would be hard to replant them onto embedded devices. In this paper, with the inspiration of GhostNet, we proposed an efficient structure ShuffleGhost to make use of the redundancy in feature maps to alleviate the cost of computations, as well as tackling some drawbacks of GhostNet. Since GhostNet suffers from high computation of convolution in Ghost module and shortcut, the restriction of downsampling would make it more difficult to apply Ghost module and Ghost bottleneck to other backbone. This paper proposes three new kinds of ShuffleGhost structure to tackle the drawbacks of GhostNet. The ShuffleGhost module and ShuffleGhost bottlenecks are utilized by the shuffle layer and group convolution from ShuffleNet, and they are designed to redistribute the feature maps concatenated from Ghost Feature Map and Primary Feature Map. Besides, they eliminate the gap of them and extract the features. Then, SENet layer is adopted to reduce the computation cost of group convolution, as well as evaluating the importance of the feature maps which concatenated from Ghost Feature Maps and Primary Feature Maps and giving proper weights for the feature maps. This paper conducted some experiments and proved that the ShuffleGhostV3 has smaller trainable parameters and FLOPs with the ensurance of accuracy.

Methods: In this paper, we present a method for identifying abnormal heart sounds based on a novel Dense Feature Selection Convolution Network framework (Dense-FSNet). The Dense-FSNet is comprised of multiple, circular dense connectivity modules, called Clique Blocks. These Clique Blocks can allow lowlevel and high-level features to stimulate each other for cyclic updates, which subsequently enhances the information flow among layers. Inspired by the channel-wise attention mechanism from Squeeze-and Excitation Networks (SENet), we adopted squeeze-and-excitation block to avoid the progressive growth of parameters. The effect of the model was assessed using the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under the curve (AUC) values. To improve model performance, in addition to the structures mentioned above, we incorporated a multi-scale attention mechanism into our framework. Results: Using this attention mechanism, our model was able to achieve adaptively spatial feature fusion by adjusting a hyper-feature that contains higher level visual information and lower-level features including edge details and context information. It is worth noting that data balance technology was also used in the process of building the model, and notable results have been achieved. Conclusions: Experience using the PhysioNet/CinC 2016 dataset shows that our proposed Dense-FSNet models achieve state of the art levels in the classification and detection of abnormal heart sounds.","[Zhou, Xin; Liu, Ying; Chen, Sun; Wu, Yurong; Du, Bowen; Sun, Kun] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Xinhua Hosp, Pediat Heart Ctr, 1665 Kongjiang Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xin; Sun, Xin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Xinhua Hosp, Sch Med, Clin Res Unit, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xuying; Li, Xianhong; Zhang, Yao] Ewell Technol Co Ltd, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jingtao] Xunyin Intelligent Technol Shanghai Co Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaowen] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Xinhua Hosp, Inst Dev & Regenerat Cardiovasc Med, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,"Sun, K (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Xinhua Hosp, Pediat Heart Ctr, 1665 Kongjiang Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",sunkun@xinhuamed.com.cn,,,Research project of Shanghai Translational Medicine Collaborative Innovation Center [TM202007]; Clinical innovation project of Xinhua Hospital [19XHCR14D],Research project of Shanghai Translational Medicine Collaborative Innovation Center; Clinical innovation project of Xinhua Hospital,The project was funded by Research project of Shanghai Translational Medicine Collaborative Innovation Center (TM202007) and Clinical innovation project of Xinhua Hospital (19XHCR14D) .,,32,0,0,9,12,AME PUBL CO,SHATIN,"FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",2305-5839,2305-5847,,ANN TRANSL MED,ANN.

Early diagnosis and control of maize leaf diseases help ensure maize yield and quality. However, early maize leaf diseases show small spots and irregular shapes in natural scene images, resulting in current models having difficulty identifying maize leaf diseases accurately. This study proposes a SKPSNet-50 convolutional neural network model to realize the accurate identification of maize leaf diseases in natural scene images. The proposed model replaces the 3 x 3 convolution kernel in the backbone network ResNet-50 with Select Kernel-Point-Swish_B (SKPS), which is an improved building block of the selected kernel (SK) unit, and replaces the ReLU activation function with the Swish_B activation function to improve the feature extraction capability of diseased leaves with small spots and irregular shapes. In addition, this study adopts the combined focal loss function to guide the parameter adjustment of the model to solve the problem of data imbalance. Experimental results show that compared with classic machine learning models (such as BP neural network and support vector machine) and deep neural network models (such as AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet-50, SENet-50, SKNet-50 and GhostNet), the proposed model is more effective in the identification of maize leaf diseases in natural scene images, with an average identification accuracy of 92.9%, which is about 6% higher than that of the SKNet-50 model.","[Zeng, Weihui; Li, Haidong; Hu, Gensheng; Liang, Dong] Anhui Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Agroecol Big Data Anal & Applic, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Weihui] Univ Sci & Technol China, Guochuang Software Co Ltd, Hefei 230088, Peoples R China",,"Hu, GS (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Agroecol Big Data Anal & Applic, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China.",hugs2906@sina.com,,"Zeng, Weihui/0000-0002-5164-6966","Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province, China [2108085MC95]; Science and Technology Project of Anhui Provice, China [202003a06020016]; Natural Science Research Project of Anhui colleges and universities, China [KJ2020ZD03, KJ2020A0039]; Open Research Fund of National Engineering Research Center for Agro-Ecological Big Data Analysis & Application, Anhui University [AE202004]","Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); Science and Technology Project of Anhui Provice, China; Natural Science Research Project of Anhui colleges and universities, China; Open Research Fund of National Engineering Research Center for Agro-Ecological Big Data Analysis & Application, Anhui University","This work was supported in part by Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province, China, under Grant No.2108085MC95, and Science and Technology Project of Anhui Provice, China, under Grant No.202003a06020016, and Natural Science Research Project of Anhui colleges and universities, China, under Grant Nos.

Our suggested method is mainly proposed to solve the problem of not being able to detect ewe estrus behavior in a timely and accurate manner in large-scale meat sheep farms. The three main steps of our proposed methodology include constructing the dataset, improving the network structure, and detecting the ewe estrus behavior based on the lightweight network. First, the dataset was constructed by capturing images from videos with estrus crawling behavior, and the data enhancement was performed to improve the generalization ability of the model at first. Second, the original Darknet-53 was replaced with the EfficientNet-B0 for feature extraction in YOLO V3 neural network to make the model lightweight and the deployment easier, thus shortening the detection time. In order to further obtain a higher accuracy of detecting the ewe estrus behavior, we joined the feature layers to the SENet attention module. Finally, the comparative results demonstrated that the proposed method had higher detection accuracy and FPS, as well as a smaller model size than the YOLO V3. The precision of the proposed scheme was 99.44%, recall was 95.54%, F1 value was 97%, AP was 99.78%, FPS was 48.39 f/s, and Model Size was 40.6 MB.

Listed offensive activities could strongly effect on national defence and security capabilities, influencing on mind of population. Paper describes conceptual correlation among the strategic concept of communication operationalised in project management with psychological behaviour influence in cyberspace. Paper offers modeling of the project approach to designing of strategic communication in the scope of the contemporary digital era. The paper analyses Internet contents on social networks through aspects of possible influence on behaviour and attitudes of the target public, as an object of strategic communication project management.","[Mitrovic, Miroslav] Univ Def, Strateg Res Inst, Belgrade, Serbia; [Vulic, Ana] Minist Def, Serbian Armed Forces, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Mitrovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Def, Strateg Res Inst, Belgrade, Serbia.",mitrovcmm@gmail.com; ana.vulic@vs.rs,"Mitrovic, Miroslav/H-3920-2017; Vulić, Ana/AAX-4506-2021","Mitrovic, Miroslav/0000-0001-7541-8565; ",,,,,41,0,0,1,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-861-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2019.0,108,,,,,,76,82,,,,,,7,Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP1JP,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000539503700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

So, today, there are a few project management standards that can help organisations in directing a project into a regular and systematic framework. The main goal of this paper is to analyse and make a comparison between two of the most popular versions of project management standards: ISO 21500 and PMBOK 6th Guide. A general overview of differences and similarities, definitions of important terms of project management, project management processes and knowledge areas were essential for analysis. The 6th edition of the PMBOK (R) Guide and ISO 21500 standards are very similar. A set of processes are pretty organised similarly, but the approach of those two standards is different. The ISO 21500 standard is about process introduction and inputs and outputs of the project. At the other side, PMBOK (R) Guide gives more detailed picture about project management processes, their inputs, and outputs as tools and techniques in a more detailed way. Also, it is noticed that processes are matching in many cases, but there is a difference in naming style noted.","[Cabarkapa, Jovana] Fac Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Cabarkapa, J (通讯作者)，Fac Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia.",jovana.cabarkapa95@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,1,1,3,6,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-861-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2019.0,108,,,,,,266,271,,,,,,6,Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP1JP,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000539503700043,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, when incorporating long-term temporal dependencies between features, recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures are typically employed by default. In this work, we aim to present an efficient deep neural network architecture incorporating Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss for discrete speech emotion recognition (SER). Moreover, we also demonstrate the existence of further opportunities to improve SER performance by exploiting the properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when modelling contextual information. Our proposed model uses parallel convolutional layers (PCN) integrated with Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SEnet), a system herein denoted as PCNSE, to extract relationships from 3D spectrograms across timesteps and frequencies; here, we use the log-Mel spectrogram with deltas and delta-deltas as input. In addition, a self-attention Residual Dilated Network (SADRN) with CTC is employed as a classification block for SER. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that such a hybrid architecture has been employed for discrete SER. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) and FAU-Aibo Emotion corpus (FAU-AEC). Our experimental results reveal that the proposed method is well-suited to the task of discrete SER, achieving a weighted accuracy (WA) of 73.1% and an unweighted accuracy (UA) of 66.3% on IEMOCAP, as well as a UA of 41.1% on the FAU-AEC dataset.

It can be flexibly embedded with different network architectures to boost the performance of the original networks. The WHE layer is composed of a wide hidden layer, in which each channel only connects with two input channels and one output channel. Before connecting to the output channel, each intermediate channel in the WHE layer is followed by one activation function. In this manner, the number of activation functions can grow along with the number of channels in the hidden layer. We apply the WHE layer to ResNet, WideResNet, SENet, and MobileNet architectures and evaluate on ImageNet, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet dataset. On the ImageNet dataset, models with the WHE layer can achieve up to 2.01% higher Top-1 accuracy than baseline models, with less than 4% computation increase and less than 2% more parameters. On CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet, when applying the WHE layer to ResNet models, it demonstrates consistent improvement in the accuracy of the networks. Applying the WHE layer to ResNet backbone of the CenterNet object detection model can also boost its performance on COCO and Pascal VOC datasets.","[Wang, Min; Foroosh, Hassan] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Liu, Baoyuan] Amazon, Seattle, WA USA",,"Wang, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",mwang@cs.ucf.edu; baoyuan@amazon.com; foroosh@cs.ucf.edu,,,,,,,34,1,1,1,3,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",2472-6737,,978-1-7281-6553-0,IEEE WINT CONF APPL,,,2020.0,,,,,,,923,931,,,,,,9,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BQ1ZB,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000578444800096,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents deep compositional grammatical architectures which harness the best of two worlds: grammar models and DNNs. The proposed architectures integrate compositionality and reconfigurability of the former and the capability of learning rich features of the latter in a principled way. We utilize AND-OR Grammar (AOG) [53, 71, 70] as network generator in this paper and call the resulting networks AOGNets. An AOGNet consists of a number of stages each of which is composed of a number of AOG building blocks. An AOG building block splits its input feature map into N groups along feature channels and then treat it as a sentence of N words. It then jointly realizes a phrase structure grammar and a dependency grammar in bottom-up parsing the sentence for better feature exploration and reuse. It provides a unified framework for the best practices developed in state-of-the-art DNNs. In experiments, AOGNet is tested in the ImageNet-1K classification benchmark and the MS-COCO object detection and segmentation benchmark. In ImageNet-1K, AOGNet obtains better performance than ResNet [21] and most of its variants, ResNeXt [63] and its attention based variants such as SENet [24], DenseNe[26] and DualPathNet [6]. AOGNet also obtains the best model interpretability score using network dissection [3]. AOGNet further shows better potential in adversarial defense. In MS-COCO, AOGNet obtains better performance than the ResNet and ResNeXt backbones in Mask R-CNN [20].","[Li, Xilai; Wu, Tianfu] North Carolina State Univ, Dept ECE, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Wu, Tianfu] North Carolina State Univ, Visual Narrat Initiat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",,"Wu, TF (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Dept ECE, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.;Wu, TF (通讯作者)，North Carolina State Univ, Visual Narrat Initiat, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",xli47@ncsu.edu; xsong.lhi@gmail.com; tianfu_wu@ncsu.edu,,"Wu, Tianfu/0000-0001-8911-5506",ARO [W911NF1810295]; DoD DURIP [W911NF1810209]; NSF [ACI-1548562],ARO; DoD DURIP; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work is supported by ARO grant W911NF1810295 and DoD DURIP grant W911NF1810209.

Artificial intelligence has shown considerable potential in the fields of automated EEG analysis and seizure classification. However, the highly personalized representation of epileptic seizures in EEG has led to many research results that are not satisfactory in clinical applications. In order to improve the clinical adaptability of the algorithm, this paper proposes an adversarial learning-driven domain-invariant deep feature representation method, which enables the hybrid deep networks (HDN) to reliably identify seizure types. In the train phase, we first use the labeled multi-lead EEG short samples to train squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENet) to extract short-term features, and then use the compressed samples to train the long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to extract long-time features and construct a classifier. In the inference phase, we first adjust the feature mapping of LSTM through the adversarial learning between LSTM and clustering subnet so that the EEG of the target patient and the EEG in the database obey the same distribution in the deep feature space. Finally, we use the adjusted classifier to identify the type of seizure. Experiments were carried out based on the TUH EEG Seizure Corpus and CHB-MIT seizure database. The experimental results show that the proposed domain adaptive deep feature representation improves the classification accuracy of the hybrid deep model in the target set by 5%. It is of great significance for the clinical application of EEG automatic analysis equipment.","[Cao, Xincheng; Yao, Bin; Chen, Binqiang] Xiamen Univ, Sch Aerosp Engn, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Cao, Xincheng; Yao, Bin; Chen, Binqiang] Xiamen Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Sun, Weifang] Wenzhou Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Wenzhou, Peoples R China; [Tan, Guowei] Xiamen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Neurosurg, Brain Ctr,Xiamen Key Lab, Xiamen, Peoples R China",,"Yao, B (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Aerosp Engn, Xiamen, Peoples R China.;Yao, B (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;Sun, WF (通讯作者)，Wenzhou Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Wenzhou, Peoples R China.;Tan, GW (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Neurosurg, Brain Ctr,Xiamen Key Lab, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",yaobin@xmu.edu.cn; swf@wzu.edu.cn; gwtanxm@163.com,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFB1713503]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720190009],National Key Research and Development Program of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),Funding This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2020YFB1713503) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 20720190009).,,32,0,0,16,23,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1662-453X,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

This paper has a two-fold purpose. The first aim is to investigate the various deep learning models in classifying breast cancer histopathology images. This study identified the most accurate models in terms of the binary, four, and eight classifications of breast cancer histopathology image databases. The different accuracy scores obtained for the deep learning models on the same database showed that other factors such as pre-processing, data augmentation, and transfer learning methods can impact the ability of the models to achieve higher accuracy. The second purpose of our manuscript is to investigate the latest models that have no or limited examination done in previous studies. The models like ResNeXt, Dual Path Net, SENet, and NASNet had been identified with the most cutting-edge results for the ImageNet database. These models were examined for the binary, and eight classifications on BreakHis, a breast cancer histopathology image database. Furthermore, the BACH database was used to investigate these models for four classifications. Then, these models were compared with the previous studies to find and propose the most state-of-the-art models for each classification. Since the Inception-ResNet-V2 architecture achieved the best results for binary and eight classifications, we have examined this model in our study as well to provide a better comparison result. In short, this paper provides an extensive evaluation and discussion about the experimental settings for each study that had been conducted on the breast cancer histopathology images.","[Shahidi, Faezehsadat; Mohd Daud, Salwani; Abas, Hafiza; Ahmad, Noor Azurati; Maarop, Nurazean] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Razak Fac Technol & Informat, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia",,"Daud, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Razak Fac Technol & Informat, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia.",salwani.kl@utm.my,"Daud, Salwani Mohd/B-9171-2013; Ahmad, Noor Azurati/L-1262-2017; Mohd Daud, Salwani/AGP-1479-2022; Mohd Daud, Salwani/AGP-1604-2022; Abas, Hafiza/AAW-6025-2020","Daud, Salwani Mohd/0000-0002-4329-1202; Ahmad, Noor Azurati/0000-0002-7928-3474; Mohd Daud, Salwani/0000-0002-4329-1202; Abas, Hafiza/0000-0003-0137-3127; Shahidi, Faezehsadat/0000-0001-5745-4300; Maarop, Nurazean/0000-0002-2109-8380","Ministry of Education, Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia [Q.K130000.3556.05G05]","Ministry of Education, Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia); Universiti Teknologi Malaysia","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Education, Malaysia, and in part by the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Grant Q.K130000.3556.05G05.",,100,12,12,3,17,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020.0,8,,,,,,187531,187552,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029881,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029881,,,22,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,OI8WJ,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000583551400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, developing and selecting the highly performing diagnostic model suitable for clinical implications is still challenging. In this paper, we proposed a combined network of convolutional neural network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), designed for the classification of ECG heart signals for diagnostic purpose. The proposed network consists of 2 convolutional layers with $5\times 5$ kernels and ReLU activations, followed by 4 residual blocks, 2 bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) layers, as well as 2 fully connected layers. Each residual block involved the structure of a Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet) with lightweight property to recalibrate the feature map of the network. The last dense layer has 5 outputs, equivalent to the classes considered: non-ectopic beats, supraventricular ectopic beats, ventricular ectopic beats, fusion beats, and unknown beats. To train and evaluate the combined CNN and RNN, we transferred the knowledge acquired on beat classification tasks in 2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge to that in PhysionNet's MIT-BIH dataset. The developed network achieved a recognition sensitivity of 95.90%, accuracy = 95.90% and specificity = 96.34% with classification time of single sample = 6.23 s in detecting 5 ECG classes. A comparative analysis proved the high performance of the proposed combined CNN and RNN against previous methods, demonstrating the potential of our proposed network in the analysis of beat patterns. The proposed model can be applied in cloud computing or implemented in mobile devices to evaluate cardiac health with the highest precision.","[Xu, Xue; Li, Jianqiang] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Software Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xue; Jeong, Sohyun] Hebrew SeniorLife, Boston, MA 02131 USA; [Xu, Xue; Jeong, Sohyun] Harvard Med Sch, Marcus Inst Aging Res, Boston, MA 02131 USA",,"Li, JQ (通讯作者)，Shenzhen Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Software Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.",lijq@szu.edu.cn,"Jeong, Sohyun/ABC-4625-2020; LI, JIAN/GRY-2197-2022; li, jian/GSE-0245-2022","Jeong, Sohyun/0000-0003-3805-4349; ","National Nature Science Foundation of China [U1713212, 61572330]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province-Outstanding Youth Program [2019B151502018]; Technology Research Project of Shenzhen City [JSGG20180507182904693]; Public Technology Platform of Shenzhen City [GGFW2018021118145859]",National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province-Outstanding Youth Program; Technology Research Project of Shenzhen City; Public Technology Platform of Shenzhen City,"This work was supported in part by the National Nature Science Foundation of China under Grant U1713212 and Grant 61572330, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province-Outstanding Youth Program under Grant 2019B151502018, in part by the Technology Research Project of Shenzhen City under Grant JSGG20180507182904693, and in part by the Public Technology Platform of Shenzhen City under Grants GGFW2018021118145859.",,38,19,20,8,27,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020.0,8,,,,,,125380,125388,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3006707,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3006707,,,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,MS8PE,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000554534900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In each case, the ions reach a limiting intrinsic polarizability in the fully hydrated state. For F-, Cl-, and Br- using B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ, the intrinsic polarizabilities in the condensed-phase limit are 47.2 +/- 0.7%, 47.2 +/- 0.3%, and 54.2 +/- 0.4% of their gas-phase value at the corresponding level of theory. The extent of this scaling depends on the basis set (we also consider B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ), but intrinsic polarizabilities are generally within 35-55% of the gas-phase value. The sodium cation is the least polarizable in the condensed-phase limit. The average intrinsic polarizability of water in these clusters decreases with the size of the cluster, which is consistent with earlier Hirshfeld analysis of intrinsic polarizabilities of pure water (Krishtal, A.; Senet, P.; Yang, M.; van Alsenoy, C. J. Chem. Phys. 2006, 125, 034312). Further analysis demonstrates that water molecules near ions in sufficiently large clusters (n = 25) have intrinsic polarizabilities similar to those of water molecules fully coordinated in a pure aqueous cluster. The observed binodal distribution of the water intrinsic polarizability within the cluster is attributed to polarizability differences between interior and exterior water molecules. This observation is in qualitative agreement with arguments based on Pauli's exclusion principle that suggest a reduced polarizability for condensed-phase water relative to the vacuum value.","[Bauer, Brad A.; Lucas, Timothy R.; Patel, Sandeep] Univ Delaware, Dept Chem & Biochem, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Krishtal, Alisa; Van Alsenoy, Christian] Univ Antwerp, Dept Chem, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium",,"Patel, S (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Chem & Biochem, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",sapatel@udel.edu,"Patel, Sandeep/B-4502-2011","Patel, Sandeep/0000-0002-6136-3556",Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders (FWO),Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders (FWO)(FWO),A.K. acknowledges the Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders (FWO) for a postdoctoral position.,,65,22,22,0,15,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1089-5639,1520-5215,,J PHYS CHEM A,J.

Inspired by ResNet and SENet's strong ability to extract image features, we proposed a modified version of the 3D U-Net model with Res-blocks and SE-block for delineation of GTVnx. Besides, an automatic pre-processing method was proposed to crop the 3D region of interest (ROI) of GTVnx. Radiotherapy simulation CT images and corresponding manually delineated target of 205 NPC patients diagnosed with stage T1-T4 were used as datasets for training. Automated delineation models were generated based on CT combining contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) and CT alone, respectively. We compared the automatic delineation results against the manual delineated contours by radiation oncologists with 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. We also compared with the framework using 3D CNN and 2D DDNN, respectively. Besides, the model generated by one medical group was assessed against the other two separate medical groups. Precision (PR), Sensitivity (SE), Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD), and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) are calculated for quantitative evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other automatic methods on the CT images. Automated delineation models based on CT combining CE-CT is superior to that based on CT alone. The presented method could be useful and robust for the 3D delineation of GTVnx for NPC in CT images during the planning of radiotherapy.","[Wang, Xuetao; Yang, Geng; Zhu, Lin; Xue, Xiaoguang; Zhang, Bailin; Cai, Chunya; Jin, Huaizhi; Zheng, Jianxiao; Dai, Zhenhui] Guangzhou Univ Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Radiotherapy, Guangzhou 510120, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yiwen; Yang, Wei] Southern Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Guangzhou 510515, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jian] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",,"Dai, ZH (通讯作者)，Guangzhou Univ Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Radiotherapy, Guangzhou 510120, Peoples R China.;Yang, W (通讯作者)，Southern Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Guangzhou 510515, Peoples R China.",weiyanggm@gmail.com; dzh_dzh@126.com,,"Zhang, Yiwen/0000-0002-4883-0607",Ministry of Education Industry-Academic Cooperation Project [201902119002]; Guangdong medical scientific research foundation [A2019196]; Knowledge Innovation Program of Basic Research Projects of Shenzhen [JCYJ20160428182053361]; Youth Committee of Medical Engineering Branch of Guangdong Medical Association Research Projects [2019-GDMAZD - 01]; Guangdong Science and Technology Plan [2017B020210003],Ministry of Education Industry-Academic Cooperation Project; Guangdong medical scientific research foundation; Knowledge Innovation Program of Basic Research Projects of Shenzhen; Youth Committee of Medical Engineering Branch of Guangdong Medical Association Research Projects; Guangdong Science and Technology Plan,This work was supported by the Ministry of Education Industry-Academic Cooperation Project under Grant 201902119002; the Guangdong medical scientific research foundation under Grant A2019196; the Knowledge Innovation Program of Basic Research Projects of Shenzhen under Grant JCYJ20160428182053361; the Youth Committee of Medical Engineering Branch of Guangdong Medical Association Research Projects under Grant 2019-GDMAZD - 01; and the Guangdong Science and Technology Plan under Grant 2017B020210003,,30,4,4,6,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1687-8507,,,J RADIAT RES APPL SC,J.

Nowadays, with the rapid development of satellite imaging techniques, remote sensing scene classification which uses High Spatial Resolution (HSR) remote sensing images has received, considerable attention recently, as can be used in natural hazards detection, traffic control, and object detection etc. Based on the feature representation used for remote sensing scene classification, the existing scene classification approaches can be categorized into three classes: handcrafted feature based methods, unsupervised feature learning-based methods, and deep feature learning-based methods. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) , one of the deep feature learning-based methods, have achieved great success in the computer vision community. Especially, the powerful feature representations learned through CNNs have been widely used in remote sensing scene classification, but due to the different scale information of ground targets and the complex spatial distribution and texture information of the scene images, the classification effect of the scene classification algorithm based on CNN is insufficient good. For addressing the above problems, the paper proposes a multi-scale convolutional neural network driven by a sparse second-order attention mechanism (MCNN-SSAM) while comprehensively considering the accuracy of scene classification and feature dimensions. The proposed MCNN-SSAM network includes the following parts: backbone network, pyramid convolution module, sparse second-order attention module and softmax classification layer. The network firstly inserts a multi-scale convolution layer after the backbone network to acquire the characteristic expressions of different scale information targets of the ground target, and embeds the group convolution into the multi-scale convolution layer to reduce the computational complexity; Secondly, after discuss the advantage of the attention mechanism of first and second-order statistics, a sparse second order attention mechanism is proposed to enhance the discriminability of channel information of different scale convolution features. The sparsity of the attention mechanism is able to effectively reduce the feature dimension of the second-order statistics while ensuring the performance of scene classification; Finally, the multi-scale convolutional layer and the sparse second-order attention mechanism are embedded into the proposed network for end-to-end training. We conduct extensive experiments on two challenging high-resolution remote sensing data sets, i. e., AID (Aerial Image Dataset) and NWPU45 (NWPU-RESISC45) datasets. The AID dataset contains 10 000 images in RGB space, which has 30 different scene classes and of size 600 x 600 in each class; There are 31 500 optical RS images for 45 scene classes, and each image measures 256 x 256 pixels on the NWPU45 dataset. In this paper, the VGG-16 network is selected as the backbone of MCNN-SSAM, and the Adam optimizer is used for end-to-end training. The training parameters of the proposed network are set as follows: initial learning rate 0.001, weight attenuation coefficient 0.001, batch size 32, momentum 0.9. All experiments are implemented in PyTorch, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 8G 1070 Ti GPU, and 32.00 GB RAM. we make the experimental result on AID dataset to analyze the influence of some important parameters on the MCNN-SSAM, then we can conclude that the number of the atoms in the dictionary and low-rank matrix parameters have a greater impact on the remote sensing scene classification performance of the proposed MCNN-SSAM. Afterwards, we compare MCNN-SSAM with some related networks, i.e., AlexNet, VGG-16, SAFF, MSCP, and CapsNet. The experimental results show that: compared with the benchmark network (VGG-16) , the overall accuracy (OA) of MCNN-SSAM is improved by 5.27%similar to 5.34% and 10.20%similar to 10.82%; While compared with the SAFF, MSCP, and CapsNet networks, the remote sensing scene classification accuracy is improved by 0.23%similar to 1.61% and 1.34%similar to 2.75%. Additionally, based on the confusion matrix, we can observe that most of the remote sensing scene classes can be classified easily and correctly, some even achieving high classification accuracies, i.e., mountains and viaducts in the AID dataset, jungles and sea ice in the NWPU45 dataset. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the Sparse Second-order Attention Mechanism (SSAM) is verified by comparing with other related attention mechanisms and heat map results. Finally, we make the ablation generalization experiments to verify the effectiveness of MCNN-SSAM, such as SENet (Squeeze-andExcitation Networks) , CovNet which is based on covariance statistics, and SSAM. We can conclude that, whether the CNN features or multi-scale MCNN features, compared with the attention mechanism based on first-order feature statistics (CNN+SENet and MCNN+SENet) , The scene classification accuracy obtained by CNN+CovNet, CNN+SSAM, MCNN+CovNet, and MCNN+SSAM which are based on the attention mechanism of second-order feature statistics has been further improved. In addition, MCNN module, SSAM module, and the fusion of these two modules can improve the classification accuracy of remote sensing image scene images. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale convolutional neural network driven by sparse second-order attention mechanism for remote sensing scene classification. The experiment results illustrate that the proposed MCNN-SSAM improves the accuracy of remote sensing image scene classification while taking into the feature dimensions of the second order feature statistics.","[Ni Kang; Chen Zhi] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Comp Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Ni Kang] Jiangsu Key Lab Big Data Secur & Intelligent Proc, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Zhao Yuqing] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Management & Engn, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China",,"Chen, Z (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Comp Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",tznikang@163.com; chenz@njupt.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [62101280]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20210588]; Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications Science Foundation [NY220135],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications Science Foundation,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(No. 62101280),Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(No. BK20210588),Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications Science Foundation(No. NY220135)",,28,0,0,1,1,SCIENCE PRESS,EPHRATA,"300 WEST CHESNUT ST, EPHRATA, PA 17522 USA",1004-4213,,,ACTA PHOTONICA SINIC,Acta Photonica Sinica,JUN,2022.0,51,6,,,,,,,610004,10.3788/gzxb20225106.0610004,http://dx.doi.org/10.3788/gzxb20225106.0610004,,,12,Optics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Optics,3C4MD,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000828597800012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Affected by global climate change, seismic activity, and accelerated urbanization, geological disasters such as landslide collapses and debris flows in the study area have increased significantly. Therefore, it is urgent to carry out the LSE in the Yichang section of the Yangtze River Basin.

Traditional pattern recognition methods are widely used to detect defects in the industry, however most of existing methods are not very universal for all kinds of defects. Meanwhile because of the limited number of defective samples, traditional deep learning methods are not very effective in practice. This paper addresses these issues and proposes a novel few-shot learning method which combines with attention mechanism. Our method is built by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which extracts image features, and a Relation Network (RN) which calculates the similarity score between a pair of images, predicts image categories through similarity scores. Firstly, in order to extract more effective and discriminative features, we introduced Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) as an attention module into our method which can enhance effective features and weaken invalid features. Secondly, unlike traditional object detection techniques which mainly focus on foreground information, background information is also necessary in our method, because we need to utilize background information to distinguish pseudo and real defects. So in our method, we replaced Max-Pooling with Mean-Pooling. Finally, in order to solve the low efficiency of parameter update caused by sharp dropping of loss function values on our dataset, we use L1 Loss and BCELoss to replace Mean square error loss function. Experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve an average accuracy rate of 97.25% on our data set, increased by 7.92% compared with state-of-the-art.","[Lv, Qianwen] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Software Engn, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Song, Yonghong] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Song, YH (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",songyh@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2018JM6104]; National Key Research and Development Project of China [2017YFB1301101],Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China; National Key Research and Development Project of China,This work is partially supported by the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (Program No. 2018JM6104) and the National Key Research and Development Project of China 2017YFB1301101.,,18,8,9,8,30,IRON STEEL INST JAPAN KEIDANREN KAIKAN,TOKYO,"TEKKO KAIKAN-5F, 3-2-10, NIHONBASHI-KAYABACHO, TOKYO, CHUO-KU 103-0025, JAPAN",0915-1559,1347-5460,,ISIJ INT,ISIJ Int.,,2019.0,59,6,,,,,1089,1097,,10.2355/isijinternational.ISIJINT-2018-722,http://dx.doi.org/10.2355/isijinternational.ISIJINT-2018-722,,,9,Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,IG5IS,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000473837300018,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is a challenging task due to intra-class variation, crossocclusion, and unbalanced image categories in real high-density industrial farming. At present, most of the existing works on fish school feeding behavior are limited because they seem to ignored the spatial relationship between the region of interest in fish feeding images. To address this research gap, we propose a dual attention network with Efficientnet-B2 for fine-grained short-term feeding behavior analysis of fish school. The algorithm includes EfficientNet-B2 network and two parallel attention modules, which focus on the feature extraction of the feeding region. In addition, several training strategies, such as mish activation function, ranger optimizer, label smoothing, and cosine annealing, are employed to improve the algorithm performance. Especially, label smoothing technique is used to address the problem of image class imbalance. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, performance of proposed algorithm is analyzed on fish school feeding behavior dataset and it is also compared with benchmark Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) including AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ResNet, Densenet, SENet, and MobileNet. Comprehensive experimental results show that proposed algorithm achieves very good results in terms of the accuracy (the test accuracy is 89.56% on datasets), precision, parameters and floating point operations per second (FLOPS), compared with the benchmark classification algorithm. Therefore, we proposed method can be integrated into aquacultual vision system to guide farmers to plan their feeding strategy.","[Yang, Ling; Cheng, Yuelan; Mei, Siyuan; Li, Daoliang; Chen, Yingyi] China Agr Univ, Coll Informat & Elect Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ling; Cheng, Yuelan; Mei, Siyuan; Li, Daoliang; Chen, Yingyi] China Agr Univ, Natl Innovat Ctr Digital Fishery, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ling; Cheng, Yuelan; Mei, Siyuan; Li, Daoliang; Chen, Yingyi] China Agr Univ, Beijing Engn & Technol Res Ctr Internet Things Ag, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Li, Daoliang; Chen, Yingyi] China Agr Univ, Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Precis Agr Technol Integrat Res Base Fishery, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Li, Daoliang; Chen, Yingyi] Minist Agr, Key Lab Agr Informat Acquisit, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Yu, Huihui] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Duan, Yanqing] Univ Bedfordshire, Luton LU1 3JU, Beds, England",,"Chen, YY (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, 17 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",chenyingyi@cau.edu.cn,,,"National Key RAMP;D Program of China 'Next generation precision aquaculture: RAMP;D on intelligent measurement, control and equipment technologies' (China) [2017YFE0122100]; Newton UK-China Agri-Tech Project 'Advancing Digital Precision Aquaculture in China ADPAC' (UK) [BB/S020896/1]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62076244]; Key RAMP;D Program 'Research and development of intelligent model and precise monitoring of shrimp processing' [2018YFD0700904-2]","National Key RAMP;D Program of China 'Next generation precision aquaculture: RAMP;D on intelligent measurement, control and equipment technologies' (China); Newton UK-China Agri-Tech Project 'Advancing Digital Precision Aquaculture in China ADPAC' (UK); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key RAMP;D Program 'Research and development of intelligent model and precise monitoring of shrimp processing'","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China 'Next generation precision aquaculture: R&D on intelligent measurement, control and equipment technologies' (China Grant No. 2017YFE0122100) , Newton UK-China Agri-Tech Project 'Advancing Digital Precision Aquaculture in China ADPAC' (UK Grant No.: BB/S020896/1) , the National Natural Science Foundation of China 'Analysis and feature recognition on feeding behavior of fish school in facility farming based on machine vision' (No. 62076244) , and the Key R&D Program 'Research and development of intelligent model and precise monitoring of shrimp processing' (No. 2018YFD0700904-2) .",,36,3,3,27,71,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

However, due to the nonlinearity of the system, it is usually difficult for traditional methods to extract reliable fault features from its vibration signal and achieve satisfactory diagnostic accuracy under the condition of high intensity noise. In this paper, a novel fault recognition method for reciprocating compressor is proposed on the basis of signal rearrangement and attention mechanism assisted convolutional neural network. Firstly, to enhance the features of the raw signal without information loss and avoid artificial feature extraction, a novel signal rearrangement method, that can convert the raw data into 2-D format, is developed. The proposed signal rearrangement method can bring the data points into a straight line (45 degrees counterclockwise from the horizontal), which can reinforce the characteristics of the raw data and make it more intuitive. Besides, to enable the network to make adequate use of the characteristics of different channels and take global feature into consideration, the attention mechanism is introduced into the convolutional neural network classifier through the SE module of the SENet. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments, and the experimental results show that, the diagnostic accuracy of the proposed method reaches 99.4%. In addition, even under strong noise, the method of this work can still maintain an accuracy of 90.2%. Compared with other typical methods, the method suggested in this work not only holds a higher recognition accuracy, but also a stronger ability of anti-noise.","[Zhao, Dongfang; Liu, Shulin; Zhang, Hongli; Sun, Xin; Wang, Lu; Wei, Yuan] Shanghai Univ, Sch Mechatron Engn & Automat, Shanghai 200072, Peoples R China",,"Liu, SL; Zhang, HL (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sch Mechatron Engn & Automat, Shanghai 200072, Peoples R China.",lsl346@shu.edu.cn; zhang40941@126.com,"Zhao, Dongfang/AAO-6014-2021","Zhao, Dongfang/0000-0001-7937-992X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [52075310, 11802168, 61603238]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (52075310), Grant (11802168), and Grant (61603238).",,37,5,5,22,86,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2193-567X,2191-4281,,ARAB J SCI ENG,Arab.

Aiming at the low accuracy of existing crop disease recognition methods, we improve the attention mechanism and residual neural network (ResNet) to propose a dual-branch, efficient, channel attention (DECA)-based crop disease recognition model. The DECA module uses a dual-branch 1D convolution operation to filter effective feature information. It also introduces an adaptive convolution kernel parameter kand an adaptive parameter alpha to participate in the reverse training of the model so that the model can independently select effective features and establish dependencies between channels. Then, the DECA module is added to the residual module to recalibrate the channel characteristics and improve the characteristic representability of the residual module. Finally, a DECA_ResNet model is proposed to realize crop disease recognition. The crop disease model based on improved attention is verified on the AI Challenger 2018 dataset, PlantVillage dataset, and self-collected cucumber disease dataset; the disease recognition accuracies are 86.35%, 99.74% and 98.54%, respectively, which are higher than those of the ResNet and squeeze-and-excitation network (SENet) before improvement. The recognition accuracy of the proposed model in the PlantVillage dataset is higher than that of existing models. The experimental results show that the proposed plant recognition model with 18 layers (DECA_ResNet18) can achieve a high recognition accuracy. The DECA module can independently select each branch feature without causing a significant increase in the number of parameters, which improves the plant disease recognition accuracy and reduces the extraction of redundant features.","[Gao, Ronghua; Wang, Rong; Feng, Lu; Li, Qifeng; Wu, Huarui] Beijing Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Beijing Res Ctr Informat Technol Agr, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rong] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Gao, Ronghua; Wang, Rong; Feng, Lu; Li, Qifeng; Wu, Huarui] Natl Engn Res Ctr Informat Technol Agr, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China; [Gao, Ronghua; Wang, Rong; Feng, Lu; Li, Qifeng; Wu, Huarui] Minist Agr, Key Lab Informat Technol Agr, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China",,"Wang, R (通讯作者)，Beijing Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Beijing Res Ctr Informat Technol Agr, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China.",gaorh@nercita.org.cn; rongw@tju.edu.cn; fengl@nercita.org.cn; liqf@nercita.org.cn; Wuhr@nercita.org.cn,,"rong, wang/0000-0003-2977-3325",National Natural Science Foundation of China [61771058]; Beijing Municipal Science and Technology planning Project [Z191100004019007],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Municipal Science and Technology planning Project,This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 61771058]; Beijing Municipal Science and Technology planning Project [grant numbers Z191100004019007].,,38,9,9,13,46,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

To make full use of the characteristics of flight data and meteorological data, two flight delay prediction models using deep convolution neural network based on fusion of meteorological data are proposed in this paper. One is DCNN (Dual-channel Convolutional Neural Network), which refers to the ResNet network structure. The other is SE-DenseNet (Squeeze and Excitation-Densely Connected Convolutional Network), combining the advantages of DenseNet and SENet. Firstly, flight data and meteorological data are fused in the model. Then, both DCNN and SE-DenseNet models are used to extract feature automatically based on the fused flight data set. Finally, the softmax classifier is adopted to predict the flight delay level. For proposed DCNN model, both straight channel and convolution channel are designed to guarantee the lossless transmission of the feature matrix and enhance the patency of the deep network. For proposed SE-DenseNet model, a SE module is added after the convolution layer of each DenseNet block, which can not only enhance the transmission of deep information but also achieve feature recalibration in the feature extraction process. The research results indicate that after considering characteristics of meteorological information, the accuracy of the model can be improved 1% compared with only considering the flight information. The two deep convolutional neural networks proposed in this paper, DCNN and SE-DenseNet, can both effectively improve the prediction accuracies, reaching to 92.1% and 93.19%, respectively.","[Qu, Jingyi; Zhao, Ting; Ye, Meng; Liu, Chao] Civil Aviat Univ China, Tianjin Key Lab Adv Signal Proc, Tianjin 300300, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiayi] East China Air Traff Control Bur, Qingdao Air Traff Management Stn Civil Aviat Chin, Qingdao 266000, Peoples R China",,"Qu, JY (通讯作者)，Civil Aviat Univ China, Tianjin Key Lab Adv Signal Proc, Tianjin 300300, Peoples R China.",jyqu@cauc.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of China [U1833105]; Tianjin Natural Science Foundation [19JCYBJC15900]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [3122019185],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tianjin Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (U1833105), Tianjin Natural Science Foundation (19JCYBJC15900) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (3122019185).",,44,8,8,7,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1370-4621,1573-773X,,NEURAL PROCESS LETT,Neural Process.

Our system consists of three important components: 1) a nested hierarchy of product classes are automatically constructed based on visual similarities, 2) a confidence set predictor is trained based on class posteriors by using coarse-to-fine binary classifiers to discriminate each nested cluster of the hierarchy from the remainder of classes and a Bayesian network (BN) model that encodes the joint distribution of classifier scores with the fine-level class variable, and 3) n hidden Markov model (HMM) is trained with nested hidden states from the class hierarchy to model spatial transition across the nodes of product class hierarchy and resolve errors in the context-free confidence set results.

Most of the recent successful object detection methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To improve the performance of these networks, researchers have designed many different architectures. They found that the CNN performance benefits from carefully increasing the depth and width of their structures with respect to the spatial dimension. Some researchers have exploited the cardinality dimension. Others have found that skip and dense connections were also of benefit to performance. Recently, attention mechanisms on the channel dimension have gained popularity with researchers. Global average pooling is used in SENet to generate the input feature vector of the channel-wise attention unit. In this work, we argue that channel-wise attention can benefit from both global average pooling and global max pooling. We designed three novel attention units, namely, an adaptive channel-wise attention unit, an adaptive spatial-wise attention unit and an adaptive domain attention unit, to improve the performance of a CNN. Instead of concatenating the output of the two attention vectors generated by the two channel-wise attention sub-units, we weight the two attention vectors based on the output data of the two channel-wise attention sub-units. We integrated the proposed mechanism with the YOLOv3 and MobileNetv2 framework and tested the proposed network on the KITTI and Pascal VOC datasets. The experimental results show that YOLOv3 with the proposed attention mechanism outperforms the original YOLOv3 by mAP values of 2.9 and 1.2% on the KITTI and Pascal VOC datasets, respectively.

Thus, we attempt to effectively aggregate the discriminative information of actions and interactions from both RGB videos and skeleton sequences by attentively fusing multi-modal features. Recently, some nonlinear multi-modal fusion approaches are proposed by utilizing nonlinear attention mechanism that is extended from Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet). Inspired by this, we propose a novel Expansion-Squeeze-Excitation Fusion Network (ESE-FN) to effectively address the problem of elderly activity recognition, which learns modal and channel-wise Expansion-Squeeze-Excitation (ESE) attentions for attentively fusing the multi-modal features in the modal and channel-wise ways. Specifically, ESE-FN firstly implements the modal-wise fusion with the Modal-wise ESE Attention (M-ESEA) to aggregate discriminative information in modal-wise way, and then implements the channel-wise fusion with the Channel-wise ESE Attention (C-ESEA) to aggregate the multi-channel discriminative information in channel-wise way (referring to Figure 1). Furthermore, we design a new Multi-modal Loss (ML) to keep the consistency between the single-modal features and the fused multi-modal features by adding the penalty of difference between the minimum prediction losses on single modalities and the prediction loss on the fused modality. Finally, we conduct experiments on a largest-scale elderly activity dataset, i.e., ETRI-Activity3D (including 110,000+ videos, and 50+ categories), to demonstrate that the proposed ESE-FN achieves the best accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, more extensive experimental results show that the proposed ESE-FN is also comparable to the other methods in terms of normal action recognition task.","[Shu, Xiangbo; Yang, Jiawen; Yan, Rui; Song, Yan] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China",,"Song, Y (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China.",shuxb@njust.edu.cn; owen@njust.edu.cn; ruiyan@njust.edu.cn; songyan@njus.edu.cn,,"Shu, Xiangbo/0000-0003-4902-4663","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018AAA0102001]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20211520]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62072245, 61932020]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018AAA0102001, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Grant BK20211520, and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62072245 and Grant 61932020.",,71,13,13,4,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1051-8215,1558-2205,,IEEE T CIRC SYST VID,IEEE Trans.

Researchers in computer vision and affective computing focused on optimizing the classification error on benchmark data sets, which do not extensively cover possible variations that face images may undergo in real environments. Following on investigations carried out in the field of object recognition, we evaluated the robustness of existing methods for emotion recognition when their input is subjected to corruptions caused by factors present in real-world scenarios. We constructed two data sets on top of the RAF-DB test set, named RAF-DB-C and RAF-DB-P, that contain images modified with 18 types of corruption and 10 of perturbation. We benchmarked existing networks (VGG, DenseNet, SENet and Xception) trained on the original images of RAF-DB and compared them with ARM, the current state-of-the-art method on the RAF-DB test set. We carried out an extensive study on the effects that modifications to the training data or network architecture have on the classification of corrupted and perturbed data. We observed a drop of recognition performance of ARM, with the classification error raising up to 200% of that achieved on the original RAF-DB test set. We demonstrate that the use of the AutoAugment data augmentation and an anti-aliasing filter within down-sampling layers provide existing networks with increased robustness to out-of-distribution variations, substantially reducing the error on corrupted inputs and outperforming ARM. We provide insights about the resilience of existing emotion recognition methods and an estimation of their performance in real scenarios. The processing time required by the modifications we investigated (35 ms in the worst case) supports their suitability for application in real-world scenarios.

In clinical practice, automatic segmentation of the lesion from computed tomography (CT) images using deep learning methods provides an promising tool for identifying and diagnosing COVID-19. To improve the accuracy of image segmentation, an attention mechanism is adopted to highlight important features. However, existing attention methods are of weak performance or negative impact to the accuracy of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to various reasons (e.g. low contrast of the boundary between the lesion and the surrounding, the image noise). To address this issue, we propose a novel focal attention module (FAM) for lesion segmentation of CT images. FAM contains a channel attention module and a spatial attention module. In the spatial attention module, it first generates rough spatial attention, a shape prior of the lesion region obtained from the CT image using median filtering and distance transformation. The rough spatial attention is then input into two 7 x 7 convolution layers for correction, achieving refined spatial attention on the lesion region. FAM is individually integrated with six state-of-the-art segmentation networks (e.g. UNet, DeepLabV3+, etc.), and then we validated these six combinations on the public dataset including COVID-19 CT images. The results show that FAM improve the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of CNNs by 2%, and reduced the number of false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP) up to 17.6%, which are significantly higher than that using other attention modules such as CBAM and SENet. Furthermore, FAM significantly improve the convergence speed of the model training and achieve better real-time performance.

The detection algorithm uses Mobilenetv3 as the backbone feature extraction network, uses deep separable convolution instead of ordinary convolution, and uses the h-swish function instead of the swish function to reduce the number of model parameters and improve the detection speed of the model. At the same time, the SENet attention mechanism is added to the model to improve the detection accuracy, and finally the SM-YOLOv4 algorithm based on improved YOLOv4 is constructed. The experimental results of maturity detection showed that the overall average accuracy of the trained SM-YOLOv4 target detection algorithm under the verification set reached 93.52%, and the average detection time was 10.82 ms. Obtaining the spatial position of grape clusters is a grape cluster pre-positioning method based on binocular stereo vision. In the pre-positioning experiment, the maximum error was 32 mm, the mean error was 27 mm, and the mean error ratio was 3.89%.

Early and accurate diagnosis is therefore important, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple and effective method for achieving this. However, it requires assessment by a specialist; so many recent works have focused on the automatic assessment of ECG signals. MethodsFor the detection and localization of MI, deep learning models have been proposed, but the diagnostic accuracy of this approaches still need to be improved. Moreover, with deep learning methods the way in which a given result was achieved lacks interpretability. In this study, ECG data was obtained from the PhysioBank open access database, and was analyzed as follows. Firstly, the 12-lead ECG signal was preprocessed to identify each beat and obtain each heart interval. Secondly, a multi-scale deep learning model combined with a residual network and attention mechanism was proposed, where the input was the 12-lead ECG recording. Through the SENet model and the Grad-CAM algorithm, the weighting of each lead was calculated and visualized. Using existing knowledge of the way in which different types of MI gave characteristic patterns in specific ECG leads, the model was used to provisionally diagnose the type of MI according to the characteristics of each of the 12 ECG leads. ResultsTen types of MI anterior, anterior lateral, anterior septal, inferior, inferior lateral, inferior posterior, inferior posterior lateral, lateral, posterior, and posterior lateral were diagnosed. The average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for MI detection of all lesion types was 99.98, 99.94, and 99.98%, respectively; and the average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for MI localization was 99.79, 99.88, and 99.98%, respectively.

Nonetheless, the approach has some problems, for example, identification takes a long time, has low accuracy, and is often limited to a single disease type. Here, we aimed to identify tomato powdery mildew, leaf mold and cucumber downy mildew against simple and complex backgrounds. We developed a vegetable disease identification model, DTLSE-ResNet50, optimized by SENet and pre-trained by ImageNet to form a new model, SE-ResNet50. The SEResNet50 model was trained with the AI Challenger 2018 public database to obtain a new weight. The SEResNet50 model with the new weight was then trained by dual transfer learning with a self-built database to create the DTL-SE-ResNet50 model for the identification of vegetable diseases. The model was compared with convolutional neural networks EfficientNet, AlexNet, VGG19, and Inception V3. The experimental results showed that with the same experimental conditions, the identification precision of the new model reached 97.24%, and processing of a single image required 0.13 s. Compared with DTL-CBAM-ResNet50 and DTL-SA-ResNet50, three models has almost the same precision, but time consumption of DTL-SE-ResNet50 was 0.02 s higher than that of DTL-CBAM-ResNet50. Although the time consumption of DTL-SA-ResNet50 was 0.02 s higher than the proposed model, the precision was lower. At the same time, compared with the dual transfer learning model, the model's precision was 4.1% higher, and the processing of a single image was 0.06 s shorter. Compared with convolutional neural networks, the precision of DTL-SE-ResNet50 was 3.19% higher than the best result, the time consumption of a single image was 0.58 s shorter; Recall and F1 also increased.

Many new varieties are bred every year. The accurate judgment of wheat varieties can promote the development of the wheat industry and the protection of breeding property rights. Although gene analysis technology can be used to accurately determine wheat varieties, it is costly, time-consuming, and inconvenient. Traditional machine learning methods can significantly reduce the cost and time of wheat cultivars identification, but the accuracy is not high. In recent years, the relatively popular deep learning methods have further improved the accuracy on the basis of traditional machine learning, whereas it is quite difficult to continue to improve the identification accuracy after the convergence of the deep learning model. Based on the ResNet and SENet models, this paper draws on the idea of the bagging-based ensemble estimator algorithm, and proposes a deep learning model for wheat classification, CMPNet, which is coupled with the tillering period, flowering period, and seed image. This convolutional neural network (CNN) model has a symmetrical structure along the direction of the tensor flow. The model uses collected images of different types of wheat in multiple growth periods. First, it uses the transfer learning method of the ResNet-50, SE-ResNet, and SE-ResNeXt models, and then trains the collected images of 30 kinds of wheat in different growth periods. It then uses the concat layer to connect the output layers of the three models, and finally obtains the wheat classification results through the softmax function. The accuracy of wheat variety identification increased from 92.07% at the seed stage, 95.16% at the tillering stage, and 97.38% at the flowering stage to 99.51%. The model's single inference time was only 0.0212 s. The model not only significantly improves the classification accuracy of wheat varieties, but also achieves low cost and high efficiency, which makes it a novel and important technology reference for wheat producers, managers, and law enforcement supervisors in the practice of wheat production.","[Gao, Jiameng; Liu, Chengzhong; Han, Junying; Bai, Xuguang; Luo, Jiake] Gansu Agr Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, 1 Yinmencun Rd, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China; [Lu, Qinglin] Wheat Res Inst, Gansu Acad Agr Sci, 1 Xincun, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hengxing] Tianshui Agr Sch, Training Sect, 12,Taishan Rd, Tianshui 741400, Qingshui, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jianhua] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Agr Informat Inst, 12,Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",,"Liu, CZ (通讯作者)，Gansu Agr Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, 1 Yinmencun Rd, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",gaojm@st.gsau.edu.cn; liucz@gsau.edu.cn; hanjy@gsau.edu.cn; gsnkylql@gsagr.ac.cn; wanghx1970@gmail.com; zhangjianhua@caas.cn; baixuguang6@gmail.com; l1159060283@gmail.com,,"Han, Junying/0000-0001-9405-279X","Innovation Fund Project of Colleges and Universities in Gansu of China [2021A-056]; Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province, China [20JR5RA023]; Industrial Support and Guidance Project of Universities in Gansu Province, China [2021CYZC-57]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31971792]","Innovation Fund Project of Colleges and Universities in Gansu of China; Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province, China; Industrial Support and Guidance Project of Universities in Gansu Province, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the Innovation Fund Project of Colleges and Universities in Gansu of China (Grant No.2021A-056); by the Natural Science Foundation of Gansu Province, China (Grant No.20JR5RA023); by the Industrial Support and Guidance Project of Universities in Gansu Province, China (Grant No. 2021CYZC-57); and by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.31971792).",,33,0,0,9,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-8994,,SYMMETRY-BASEL,Symmetry-Basel,NOV,2021.0,13,11,,,,,,,2012,10.3390/sym13112012,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym13112012,,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,XL2RA,,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000727995300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is common in humid regions and Chinese cultures with ear-cleaning custom. Aspergillus and Candida are the major pathogens causing long-term infection. Early endoscopic and microbiological examinations, performed by otologists and microbiologists, respectively, are important for the appropriate medical treatment of otomycosis. The deep-learning model is a novel automatic diagnostic program that provides quick and accurate diagnoses using a large database of images acquired in clinical settings. The aim of the present study was to introduce a machine-learning model to accurately and quickly diagnose otomycosis caused by Aspergillus and Candida. We propose a computer-aided decision-making system based on a deep-learning model comprising two subsystems: Java web application and image classification. The web application subsystem provides a user-friendly webpage to collect consulted images and display the calculation results. The image classification subsystem mainly trained neural network models for end-to-end data inference. The end user uploads a few images obtained with the ear endoscope, and the system returns the classification results to the user in the form of category probability values. To accurately diagnose otomycosis, we used otoendoscopic images and fungal culture secretion. Fungal fluorescence, culture, and DNA sequencing were performed to confirm the pathogens Aspergillus or Candida spp. In addition, impacted cerumen, external otitis, and normal external auditory canal endoscopic images were retained for reference. We merged these four types of images into an otoendoscopic image gallery. To achieve better accuracy and generalization abilities after model-training, we selected 2,182 of approximately 4,000 ear endoscopic images as training samples and 475 as validation samples. After selecting the deep neural network models, we tested the ResNet, SENet, and EfficientNet neural network models with different numbers of layers. Considering the accuracy and operation speed, we finally chose the EfficientNetB6 model, and the probability values of the four categories of otomycosis, impacted cerumen, external otitis, and normal cases were outputted. After multiple model training iterations, the average accuracy of the overall validation sample reached 92.42%. The results suggest that the system could be used as a reference for general practitioners to obtain more accurate diagnoses of otomycosis.","[Mao, Chenggang; Peng, Dan] Yangtze Univ, Jingzhou Hosp, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Jingzhou, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Li, Aimin] Yangtze Univ, Jingzhou Hosp, Dept Pediat, Jingzhou, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Hu, Jing; Sun, Yi] Yangtze Univ, Jingzhou Hosp, Dept Dermatol, Jingzhou, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Pengjun] Yangtze Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Jingzhou, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Juehui] Jingzhou Univ, Dept Informat Engn, Jingzhou, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Wang, JH (通讯作者)，Jingzhou Univ, Dept Informat Engn, Jingzhou, Hubei, Peoples R China.",m13886588857@163.com,,,Health Commission of Hubei Province scientific research project; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2021M261];  [2019CFB567],Health Commission of Hubei Province scientific research project; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province); ,"This work was supported by Health Commission of Hubei Province scientific research project (Grant No. JW 2021M261 to YS), the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (Grant No. 2019CFB567 to YS).",,34,0,0,2,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-889X,,FRONT MOL BIOSCI,Front.

It is important that these pests are timely and accurately monitored for controlling them and ensuring food security. Insect radar is effective monitoring equipment for migratory pests flying at high altitude. But insect radar is costly and has not been widely used in fields. Searchlight trap is an economical device, which uses light to trap migratory pests at high altitude. But the trapped pests need to be manually identified and counted from a large number of non-target insects, which is inefficient and labor-intensive. In order to replace manual identification of migratory pests, we develop an intelligent monitoring system of migratory pests based on searchlight trap and machine vision. This system includes a searchlight trap based on machine vision, an automatic identification model of migratory pests, a Web client, and a cloud server. The searchlight trap attracts the high-altitude migratory insects through lights at night and kills them with the infrared heater. All trapped insects are dispersed through a multiple layers of insect conveyor belts and a revolving brush. The machine vision module collects the dispersed insect images and sends them to the cloud server through 4G network. The improved model YOLO-MPNet based on YOLOv4 and SENet channel attention mechanism is proposed to detect three species of migratory pests in the images. The results show that the model effectively improves the detection effect of three migratory pests. The precision is 94.14% for C. medinalis, 85.82% for S. furcifera, and 88.79% for N. lugens. The recall is 91.99% for C. medinalis, 82.47% for S. furcifera, and 85.00% for N. lugens. Compared with some state-of-the-art models (Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, and YOLOv5), our model shows a low false detection and missing detection rates. The intelligent monitoring system can real-timely and automatically monitor three migratory pests instead of manually pest identification and count, which can reduce the technician workload. The trapped pest images and historical data can be visualized and traced, which provides reliable evidence for forecasting and controlling migratory pests.","[Sun, Guojia; Luo, Haolun; Feng, Zelin; Yao, Qing; Xu, Jiajun] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shuhua; Yang, Baojun; Luo, Ju; Tang, Jian] China Natl Rice Res Inst, State Key Lab Rice Biol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China",,"Yao, Q (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.;Liu, SH (通讯作者)，China Natl Rice Res Inst, State Key Lab Rice Biol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.",liushuhua@caas.cn; q-yao@126.com,,,,,,,26,1,1,10,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

The shape of rectal cancer has significant variations and the shape of some surrounding organs is similar to that of rectal cancer; these conditions significantly affect the segmentation accuracy of rectal cancer and lead to incorrect segmentation. Therefore, automatic segmentation of rectal cancer is urgently needed, and it is a great challenge. For this task, the existing deep learning-based approaches have two shortcomings: 1) The U-Net network plays an important role in the field of medical segmentation. However, the designs of encoders and decoders in traditional U-Net networks are relatively simple and cannot extract good features, resulting in incorrect segmentation results. 2) Conventional neural networks extract high-level features that often do not include sufficient high-resolution contour information, resulting in ambiguity in contour segmentation. In this paper, we propose an improved U-Net network based on contour prediction, aiming at effective segmentation of rectal cancer. Methods: We designed a new U-Net network by improving the traditional U-Net network. We made four improvements: 1) We replaced the encoders with the SENet network. 2) A global pooling layer was added after the last encoder. 3) We added the Spatial and Channel Squeeze & Excitation (SCSE) attention mechanism module to each decoder. 4) We concatenated the output results of each decoder. In addition, the model implemented content segmentation and contour segmentation for rectal cancer in parallel, so that both the content and contour information was learned by the network to enhance the segmentation accuracy. Results: Our data were obtained from the Shanxi Provincial Cancer Hospital and included 3773 2D MRI rectal cancer images. The proposed method achieved an Mean Intersection over Union of 0.894 (MIoU) on the test set. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method had the best performance on the test set, and its MIoU metric was 0.123 higher than that of the second-best model. At the same time, the effectiveness of the improvements to our method was demonstrated through ablation experiments. Conclusions: Our method can help radiologists to segment effectively, save their time and energy, and enable them to focus on cases that are not easily segmented because of the complex shape of rectal cancer.

In this letter, a bilinear squeeze-and-excitation network (BiSENet) is proposed for fine-grained classification of tree species. First, objects of the remote sensing data are constructed based on superpixel segmentation. Second, a deep neural network (i.e., BiSENet) is constructed and trained to distinguish different tree species. The proposed BiSENet is inspired by the fine-grained image classification, which is more subtle than traditional classification since it classifies the images within a subordinate category. Moreover, the AdaBound optimization method is adopted to obtain the optimal parameters of BiSENet. Experiments on the Haizhu Lake data acquired by the Jilin-1 satellite demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior quantitative and qualitative performance than existing state-of-the-art methods.","[He, Zhi] Sun Yat Sen Univ SYSU, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Ctr Integrated Geog Informat Anal,Southern Marine, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [He, Dan] Dongguan Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat, City Coll, Dongguan 511700, Peoples R China",,"He, Z (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ SYSU, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Ctr Integrated Geog Informat Anal,Southern Marine, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.",hezh8@mail.sysu.edu.cn; hdhzhd@126.com,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB0505500, 2018YFB0505503]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2019A1515011877]; Guangzhou Science and Technology Planning Project [202002030240]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [19lgzd10]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41501368]; Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai) [99147-42080011]; 2018 Key Research Platforms and Research Projects of Ordinary Universities in Guangdong Province [2018KQNCX360]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Guangzhou Science and Technology Planning Project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai); 2018 Key Research Platforms and Research Projects of Ordinary Universities in Guangdong Province,"This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018YFB0505500 and Grant 2018YFB0505503, in part by the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation under Grant 2019A1515011877, in part by the Guangzhou Science and Technology Planning Project under Grant 202002030240, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 19lgzd10, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41501368, in part by the Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai) under Grant 99147-42080011, and in part by the 2018 Key Research Platforms and Research Projects of Ordinary Universities in Guangdong Province under Grant 2018KQNCX360.",,32,4,4,4,12,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1545-598X,1558-0571,,IEEE GEOSCI REMOTE S,IEEE Geosci.

The computed tomography (CT) scan has become the choice of medical experts to diagnose hepatic anomalies. However, due to advance-ments in CT image acquisition protocol, CT scan data is growing and manual delineation of the liver and tumor from the CT volume becomes cumbersome and tedious for medical experts. Thus, the outcome becomes highly reliant on the operator's proficiency. Further, automatic liver and tumor segmentation from CT images is challenging due to complicated parenchyma, highly variable shape, and fewer voxel intensity variation among the liver, tumor, neighbouring organs, and discontinuity in liver boundaries. Recently deep learning (DL) exhibited extraordinary potential in medical image interpretation. Because of its effectiveness in performance advancement, the DL-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) gained significant interest in the medical realm. The proposed HFRU-Net is derived from the UNet ar-chitecture by modifying the skip pathways using local feature reconstruction and feature fusion mech-anism that represents the detailed contextual information in the high-level features. Further, the fused features are adaptively recalibrated by learning the channel-wise interdependencies to acquire the promi-nent details of the modified high-level features using the squeeze-and-Excitation network (SENet). Also, in the bottleneck layer, we employed the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module to represent the multiscale features with dissimilar receptive fields to represent the rich spatial information in the low-level features. These amendments uplift the segmentation performance and reduce the computational complexity of the model than outperforming methods. The efficacy of the proposed model is proved by widespread experimentation on two datasets available publicly (LiTS and 3DIrcadb). The experimental result analysis illustrates that the proposed model has attained a dice similarity coefficient of 0.966 and 0.972 for liver segmentation and 0.771 and 0.776 for liver tumor segmentation on LiTS and the 3DIRCADb dataset. Further, the robustness of the HFRU-Net is confirmed on the independent LiTS challenge test dataset. The proposed model attained the global dice of 95.0% for liver segmentation and 61.4% for tumor segmentation which is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Setting: Ambulatory or hospitalized patients from 17 dermatology departments. Patients: Between January 1, 2006, and May 31, 2008, a total of 144 patients consulted for CLUs, attributed to venous and/or peripheral arterial disease(s), increasing in wound size, that is, larger area and/or depth, despite appropriate standard treatment for at least 3 months. Main Outcome Measures: At inclusion, at least two 6-mm punch biopsies, 1 at the wound edge and 1 in the wound bed, in the most clinically suspicious areas, were systematically performed. The primary end point was the skin cancer frequency diagnosed in at least 1 wound biopsy specimen obtained at inclusion. Results: The 144 patients included had 154 CLUs. The overall skin cancer frequency in the CLUs was 10.4%: 9 squamous cell and 5 basal cell carcinomas, 1 melanoma, and 1 leiomyosarcoma; 56.3% had persisted for at least 3 years. Univariate analyses retained older age, abnormal excessive granulation tissue at wound edges, high clinical suspicion of cancer, and number of biopsies, but not wound area or duration, as being significantly associated with skin cancer in 1 or more biopsy specimens. Conclusions: The combined primary ulcerated cancer or malignant transformation frequency was sufficiently high in CLUs referred to tertiary care centers to consider systematic biopsy of a wound refractory to 3 months or more of appropriate treatment.","[Senet, Patricia] Univ Paris 05, Serv Dermatol, Hop Tenon, AP HP, F-75970 Paris 20, France; [Combemale, Patrick] Ctr Leon Berard, Dept Dermatol, F-69373 Lyon, France; [Debure, Clelia] Hop Corentin Celton, AP HP, Dept Vasc Rehabil, Issy Les Moulineaux, France; [Baudot, Nathalie] Hop St Louis, Dept Dermatol, AP HP, Paris, France; [Machet, Laurent] Hop Trousseau, Dept Dermatol, Tours, France; [Machet, Laurent] Univ Tours, Tours, France; [Aout, Mounir; Vicaut, Eric] Univ Paris 07, Hop Fernand Widal, AP HP, Unite Rech Clin, Paris, France; [Lok, Catherine] Hop Nord Amiens, Dept Dermatol, Amiens, France",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 05, Serv Dermatol, Hop Tenon, AP HP, 4 Rue Chine, F-75970 Paris 20, France.",patricia.senet@tnn.aphp.fr,"Machet, Laurent/A-2976-2010","Machet, Laurent/0000-0001-5985-878X; Maruani, Annabel/0000-0003-3734-810X; Leccia, M.Therese/0000-0003-1222-0396",Urgo Medical; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris; French Society of Dermatology; Urgo Medical France,Urgo Medical; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris; French Society of Dermatology; Urgo Medical France,"Drs Senet, Debure, Combemale, and Lok have received fees from Urgo Medical as investigators in clinical studies on venous ulcer dressings.; This study was funded by grants from the Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, by the French Society of Dermatology, and by a research grant from Urgo Medical France in 2006.",,17,54,55,0,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60654-0946 USA",0003-987X,,,ARCH DERMATOL,Arch.

We demonstrate that the hardness/softness kernels of an isolated system can be expanded in eigenmodes, solutions of a variational principle. These modes are divided into two groups: the polarization modes and the charging modes. The eigenvectors of the polarization modes are orthogonal to the Fukui function and can be interpreted as densities induced at a constant chemical potential. The charging modes of an isolated system are associated with virtual charge transfers weighted by the Fukui function and obey an exact nontrivial sum rule. The exact relation between these charging eigenmodes and those of the polarizability kernel is established. The physical interpretation of the modes is discussed. Applications of the present findings to the Thomas-Fermi and von Weizacker kinetic energy functionals are presented. For a confined free quantum gas, described by the von Weizacker kinetic energy functional, we succeed to derive an approximate analytical solution for the Fukui function and for hardness/softness and polarizability kernels. Finally, we indicate how numerical calculations of the hardness kernel of a molecule could be performed from the Kohn-Sham orbitals.","[Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, UMR 6303 CNRS, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, F-21078 Dijon, France",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, UMR 6303 CNRS, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, F-21078 Dijon, France.",psenet@u-bourgogne.fr,,,EIPHI Graduate School [ANR-17-EURE-0002]; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne-Franche-Comte,EIPHI Graduate School; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne-Franche-Comte(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte),The simulations were performed using HPC resources from DSI-CCuB (Universite de Bourgogne).

Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 +/- 0.05, 0.79 +/- 0.04, and 0.62 +/- 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD. Further research is needed to examine the clinical implication of the finding, capability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to help understand and evaluate an individual subject's disease status, symptom burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe depression, in a data-driven way.","[Pan, Dan; Zeng, An; Jia, Longfei; Huang, Yin] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Comp, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zeng, An] Guangdong Key Lab Big Data Anal & Proc, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Frizzell, Tory; Son, Xiaowei] Fraser Hlth, SFU ImageTech Lab, Surrey Mem Hosp, Surrey, BC, Canada",,"Zeng, A (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Comp, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Zeng, A (通讯作者)，Guangdong Key Lab Big Data Anal & Proc, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",zengan@gdut.edu.cn,,"Zeng, An/0000-0002-8730-1011","NSF of China [61976058, 61772143]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong [2019A050510041]; R&D projects in key areas of Guangdong [2019B010109001]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou [202002020090, 201804010278]; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health) [U01 AG024904]; DOD ADNI (Department of Defense) [W81XWH-12-2-0012]; National Institute on Aging; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; AbbVie; Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation; Araclon Biotech; BioClinica, Inc.; Biogen; BristolMyers Squibb Company; CereSpir, Inc.; Cogstate; Eisai Inc.; Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Eli Lilly and Company; EuroImmun; F.

In the text, we review how, from a position of subalternity (the dance of those who abound), we battle to configure new scenarios and possibilities where systematization can play interesting roles. We intend to provoke in everyone involved in the field of Social Work the desire to continue searching, to not stop exploring alternatives that will free us, to become governed, technicians and users.

They may be paroxysmal, like Raynaud's phenomenon, whitening of the fingers on exposure to cold, or erythromelalgia, a painful form of erythema induced by exposure to heat. Others are permanent or semi-permanent, such as acrocyanosis, chilblains, spontaneous haematoma of the fingers, acrocholose and digital ischaemia or necrosis. Diagnosis of the type of acrosyndrome at issue is based primarily on clinical examination and history-taking. Capillaroscopy and antinuclear antibody assay are key examinations essential for distinguishing between primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon and connective tissue disorders. Complete blood counts, screening for thyroid dysthyroidism, and antinuclear antibody assay can help distinguish between primary erythrometalgia and erythromelalgia secondary to a systemic disease, principally myeloproliferative syndrome. In the case of acrocyanosis, spontaneous digital haematomas and typical bilateral chilblains, examinations are of no value.

The purpose of this paper is proposing ways of understanding intervention as practice in an integral way, in interdependence with the macrosocial context, to achieve the necessary task of to feed, reflexively, the dimensions of social work.","[Belen Ortega-Senet, Maria] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Dept Ciencias Sociales, Concepcion, Chile; [Belen Ortega-Senet, Maria] CIEDE UCSC, Concepcion, Chile",,"Ortega-Senet, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Dept Ciencias Sociales, Concepcion, Chile.;Ortega-Senet, MB (通讯作者)，CIEDE UCSC, Concepcion, Chile.",belenmim@gmail.com,,"ORTEGA-SENET, MARIA BELEN/0000-0001-5457-6847",,,,,14,3,3,0,2,"UNIV CHILE, FAC CIENCIAS SOCIALES",SANTIAGO,"AVDA IGNACIO CARRERA PINTO 1045, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0717-554X,,,CINTA MOEBIO,Cinta Moebio,DEC,2017.0,60,,,,,,286,294,,10.4067/S0717-554X2017000300286,http://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0717-554X2017000300286,,,9,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,FU4XE,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000423855100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current treatments are fairly unsatisfactory, with long healing times in many cases, as well as a high risk of relapse. Over the last 15 years, improved understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms at work in delayed wound healing has contributed to the development of cellular therapy in this field. The use of keratinocytes or cultured fibroblasts, whether autogenic or allogenic, has been of little value in terms of either healing times or rates of complete healing. For the moment, there are very few allogenic skin substitutes available; they are expensive and have been insufficiently studied in the indication of leg ulcers. Pluripotent mesenchymal adult stem cells have proved capable of accelerating wound healing in animal models and their study in chronic wounds in humans is currently awaited.

IF phosgene is an extremely hazardous toxic gas, its main uses, strictly restricted to few specialized plants, give only benign environmental pollution, since the released by-products are hydrochloric acid and carbon dioxide. However, waste minimization requires highly selective and complete reactions and therefore efficient catalysts. The rational design of highly effective homogeneous, as well as heterogeneous phosgenation catalysts, especially hexaalkyl guanidinium chlorides, alternatively grafted on silica beads, has opened the route to environmentally improved processes. Moreover, the availability of such catalysts, combined with a better understanding of catalytic mechanisms resulted in the discovery of new selective cleaner processes to produce valuable pharmaceutical intermediates such as a-chlorinated carbonates or environmentally friendly reagents such as 1,1-dichloromethyl methyl ether. The new catalytic systems disclosed here, joined to major improvements of phosgenation techniques, opens the way to the design of non-salt and non-chlorinated waste generating routes to phosgene derivatives by recycling the released HCl.

The formal solutions of these density perturbation equations are given and the exact relations between the electronic response functions and the Hohenberg-Kohn functional are derived. Using these relations, the static nonlinear electronic response functions are constructed from the linear one. Nonconserving electron number perturbations are also directly included in the formalism to all perturbation orders. In this way the well-known results of the density-functional reactivity theory are generalized beyond the first and the second-order. This makes it possible to derive the exact relations between the Hohenberg-Kohn functional and the linear and nonlinear Fukui responses, the nonlinear Fukui functions and the nonlinear hardnesses. These relations allow us to reformulate all the derivatives of the electronic energy relative to the external potential and to the particle number in terms of the linear response kernel and in terms of the Linear Fukui function. The formalism is applied to the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac-lambda von Weiszacker model of the Hohenberg-Kohn functional.

WTmetaD guarantees a faster convergence in the long time limit in comparison with the standard metadynamics. It still suffers, however, from the same limitation, i.e., the non-trivial choice of pertinent collective variables (CVs). To circumvent this problem, we couple WTmetaD with a set of CVs generated from a dihedral Principal Component Analysis (dPCA) on the Ramachandran dihedral angles describing the backbone structure of the protein. The dPCA provides a generic method to extract relevant CVs built from internal coordinates, and does not depend on the alignment to an arbitrarily chosen reference structure as usual in Cartesian PCA. We illustrate the robustness of this method in the case of a reference model protein, the small and very diffusive Met-enkephalin pentapeptide. We propose a justification a posteriori of the considered number of CVs necessary to bias the metadynamics simulation in terms of the one-dimensional free-energy profiles associated with Ramachandran dihedral angles along the amino-acid sequence.

However, several studies have been conducted with a high level of evidence to evaluate the efficacy of treatments in venous leg ulcers, and SCLUs could benefit from these treatments, especially when a venous incompetence or an edema is associated. Pathophysiology of SCLUs includes a vasculopathy related to chronic hemolysis and an endothelial dysfunction, which could be therapeutic approaches to SCLU treatment. Critical Issues: Therapeutic approaches to SCLUs can target SCD on the one hand and skin healing and associated aggravating factors on the other. A review of the literature found only case series and six randomized controlled trials; some offered encouraging results, but most had serious biases. Clinical trials specifically targeting SCLUs are difficult to realize because of the small number of affected patients, in comparison with patients with leg ulcers from other causes. Future Direction: Treating SCLUs remains a challenge. Data in the literature are currently insufficient to offer clear treatment guidelines because of several biases in controlled studies. New studies are under way to assess the efficacy of topical treatments and describe the microbiome of SCLUs. Prevention of SCLU recurrence should be assessed in future clinical trials because the high risk of recurrence is an unsolved critical issue.","[Monfort, Jean-Benoit; Senet, Patricia] Tenon Hosp, Dept Dermatol, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France",,"Monfort, JB (通讯作者)，Tenon Hosp, Dept Dermatol, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France.",jean-benoit.monfort@aphp.fr,,,,,,,71,11,11,2,7,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",2162-1918,2162-1934,,ADV WOUND CARE,Adv.

Regranex(R) is presented in 15-gram multidose tubes. it has been approved as adjuvant treatment for neuropathic diabetic ulcerations of less than 5 cm(2), extending into the subcutaneous tissue, in the absence of ischemia, in conjunction with a standardised program of appropriate wound care, (control of infection, sharp debridement, provision of a moist environment and avoidance of pressure-on the wound). PDGF-BB promotes cutaneous wound healing by increasing proliferation and migration of dermal fibroblasts and extracellular matrix deposition. PDGF also promotes chemotaxis of neutrophils, monocytes and smooth muscle cells in wounds. Topical application of rhPDGF-BB speeds wound healing and promotes granulation tissue formation, synthesis of extracellular matrix and the inflammatory phase of the wound healing process in healthy and healing-impaired animal models. In clinical trials in humans, accelarated healing has been demonstrated in patients with lower extremity diabetic neuropathic ulcers and decubitus sores by increasing granulation tissue formation and epithelialization. Local toxicity studies in humans were negative (repeated becaplermin gel application under occlusion to intact or abraded skin, dermal sensitization tests). Pharmacokinetic studies in humans have shown that systemic absorption after topical applications was minimal. In trials, systemic and local tolerance were excellent. Reported adverse effects were similar in incidence and in nature in all groups. The 0.01% Regranex(R) gel is safe and easy to use, with single daily application.

There is considerable interest to measure and establish the role of these acoustical vibrations for biological function. So far, the technique providing the most detailed information about the acoustical modes of proteins is the very recent Extraordinary Acoustic Raman (EAR) spectroscopy. In this technique, proteins are trapped in nanoholes and excited by two optical lasers of slightly different wavelengths producing an electric field at low frequency (<100 GHz). We demonstrate that the acoustical modes of proteins studied by EAR spectroscopy are both infrared- and Raman-active modes, and we provided interpretation of the spectroscopic fingerprints measured at the single molecule level. A combination of the present calculations with techniques based on the excitation of a single nanobioparticle by an electric field, such as EAR spectroscopy, should provide a wealth of information on the role of molecular dynamics for biological function.","[Nicolai, Adrien; Delarue, Patrice; Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 6303, 9 Av A Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 6303, 9 Av A Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France.",psenet@u-bourgogne.fr,"NICOLAÏ, Adrien/P-9026-2019",,Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR); Directorate for Engineering of the National Science Foundation (NSF); Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Office; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne,Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); Directorate for Engineering of the National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Office; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte),"The authors acknowledge Dr. Fabrice Neiers (INRA, Dijon) for helpful discussions on the proteins studied in the present work.

Based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, a method is proposed to analyze the structural changes induced by ATP binding to a protein by computing the effective free-energy landscape (FEL) of a subset of its coordinates along its amino-acid sequence. The method is applied to characterize the mechanism by which the binding of ATP to the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of Hsp70 propagates a signal to its substrate-binding domain (SBD). Unbiased MD simulations were performed for Hsp70-DnaK chaperone in nucleotide-free, ADP-bound and ATP-bound states. The simulations revealed that the SBD does not interact with the NBD for DnaK in its nucleotide-free and ADP-bound states whereas the docking of the SBD was found in the ATP-bound state. The docked state induced by ATP binding found in MD is an intermediate state between the initial nucleotide-free and final ATP-bound states of Hsp70. The analysis of the FEL projected along the amino-acid sequence permitted to identify a subset of 27 protein internal coordinates corresponding to a network of 91 key residues involved in the conformational change induced by ATP binding. Among the 91 residues, 26 are identified for the first time, whereas the others were shown relevant for the allosteric communication of Hsp70 s in several experiments and bioinformatics analysis. The FEL analysis revealed also the origin of the ATP-induced structural modifications of the SBD recently measured by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance. The pathway between the nucleotide-free and the intermediate state of DnaK was extracted by applying principal component analysis to the subset of internal coordinates describing the transition. The methodology proposed is general and could be applied to analyze allosteric communication in other proteins.","[Nicolai, Adrien; Delarue, Patrice; Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, Dijon, France",,"Nicolai, A (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Phys Appl Phys & Astron, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",psenet@u-bourgogne.fr,"NICOLAÏ, Adrien/P-9026-2019",,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne; Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Conseil Regional de Bourgogne(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte); Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche,"This work was supported by funds from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, from the Conseil Regional de Bourgogne, and from the Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche.

As the name suggests, the new high-temperature (HT) extractant can be used at a higher operating temperature, but also exhibits significantly lower degradation rates, greater copper-to-iron selectivity, and is totally nitration-proof compared with the standard extractants. Pilot-plant trials have also shown that lower aqueous-inorganic entrainment can be achieved. This paper investigates the techno-economic benefit of using the HT extractant as an alternative to the standard extractant in a high-temperature application. The results of the technical evaluation showed that the use of the HT extractant reduces the extractant addition requirements and bleed volume from copper electrowinning; this smaller bleed requirement further reduces acid and limestone consumption, leading to a reduction in valuable metal losses. The results of the economic evaluation showed that the use of the HT extractant represents significant cost savings over that of the standard extractant.","[Taute, J.

Recommended risk scales are insufficiently used in everyday practice. Preventive measures must be rapidly implemented in order to reduce or eliminate factors contributing to the development of pressure sores. Risk factors include, among others, prolonged or heavy pressure, friction, shearing force, malnutrition, and bowel incontinence. Position: The position of patients with severe sensorial disorders should be changed every 2 or 3 hours. Bed rest should be interupted as soon as possible, using a cushioned chair. Reclining in the strictly lateral position (with pressure on the trochanter) must be avoided. A 30 degrees dorsal inclination in the lateral position is preferable. The reclining-silting position with a greater than 30 degrees inclination should be avoided as it increases the shearing forces applied to the sacrum. The ventral position is inappropriate for the elderly. Prevention aids: Mattresses, mattress covers, cushions and various other aids have been developed specifically:or the prevention of pressure sores but the evaluation and choice of material requires careful assessment using pressure sensors. General measures: Instruments designed to facilitate position changing help reduce the risk of friction. The general practice of massage, widely used in France, is not based on confirmed arguments of efficacy. on the contrary, certain studies would show that. such methods can have unfavorable effects. Prevention of under-nutrition and renutrition cannot be overlooked. Maintaining the patient in a dry environment (particularly in case of incontinence) and use of emollients to prevent skin drying are recommended.

Knowledge of the conformations of hHsp70 is central to understand the interactions between its nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and substrate-binding domain (SBD) and is a prerequisite to design inhibitors. The conformations of ADP-bound (or nucleotide-free) hHsp70 and ATP-bound hHsp70 was investigated by using unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of homology models of hHsp70 in explicit solvent on a timescale of .5 and 2.7 s, respectively. The conformational heterogeneity of hHsp70 was analyzed by computing effective free-energy landscapes (FELs) and distance distribution between selected pair of residues. These theoretical data were compared with those extracted from single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments and to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data of Hsp70 homologs. The distance between a pair of residues in FRET is systematically larger than the distance computed in MD which is interpreted as an effect of the size and of the dynamics of the fluorescent probes. The origin of the conformational heterogeneity of hHsp70 in the ATP-bound state is due to different binding modes of the helix B of the SBD onto the NBD. In the ADP-bound (or nucleotide-free) state, it arises from the different closed conformations of the SBD and from the different positions of the SBD relative to the NBD.

Here we predicted the existence of rare, large nonlinear excitations, termed intrinsic localized modes (ILMs), of the main chain of proteins based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of two fast-folder proteins and of a rigid alpha/beta protein at 300 K and at 380 K in solution. These nonlinear excitations arise from the anharmonicity of the protein dynamics. The ILMs were detected by computing the Shannon entropy of the protein main-chain fluctuations. In the non-native state (significantly explored at 380 K), the probability of their excitation was increased by a factor between 9 and 28 for the fast-folder proteins and by a factor 2 for the rigid protein. This enhancement in the non-native state was due to glycine, as demonstrated by simulations in which glycine was mutated to alanine. These ILMs might play a functional role in the flexible regions of proteins and in proteins in a non-native state (i.e. misfolded or unfolded states).","[Nicolai, Adrien] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Phys Appl Phys & Astron, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Nicolai, Adrien; Delarue, Patrice; Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, UMR 6303, F-21078 Dijon, France",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, UMR 6303, F-21078 Dijon, France.",psenet@u-bourgogne.fr,"NICOLAÏ, Adrien/P-9026-2019",,Conseil Regional de Bourgogne,Conseil Regional de Bourgogne(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte),The calculations were performed using HPC resources from DSI-CCUB (Universite de Bourgogne).

If surgical debridement is not possible, hypercolloid, alginate or hydrogel dressings should be applied to achieve natural autolytic cleansing. The budding and epithelization phases are also treated either with oily or humid dressings or more modern hypercellular, hydrocolloid and polyurethane film dressings. Other treatments under evaluation include physical means (negative pressure, electrical stimulation) or use of recombinant growth factors. General treatment: Surgical repair with flaps or grafts is not usually indicated in fragile elderly patients. Special attention must be given to all associated diseases (diabetes, heart failure, etc.) as well as protein-calorie nutrition. The objective is 35 cal/kg/d including 1.25 - 1.5 g protein/kg/d. Treatment of complications: Wound infection should be suspected in case of an inflammatory induration around the wound, fever, or delayed healing. Systemic antibiotics are indicated as for cellulitis. The wound is generally colonized by germs found on local bacteriological samples. Osteitis should be suspected if the wound is in contact with bone. In case of biopsy proven osteitis with positive culture, prolonged oral antibiotics are indicated. Tendon retractions should benefit from rehabilitation exercises and surgery in case of medical failure.

The polarizability of the hydroxyl group was found to be dependent on the number, type, and strength of the hydrogen bonds a methanol molecule makes, whereas the polarizability of the methyl groups is mostly influenced by sterical hindrance.

The dielectric properties and geometries of the clusters are also evaluated using the second order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (for the clusters up to 15 molecules) for comparison with the DFT results. Based on these data and a simple model, one establishes the influence of the intermolecular interactions on the effective dipole and polarisability of a molecule in a cluster.

When located in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy subjects, it behaves as a commensal of normal flora. Following even slight weakening of host defenses, the fungus may proliferate causing inflammatory host reaction. Passage from the commensal status to pathogenicity is accompanied by modifications of the fungus which then act as virulence factors. Development of filamentous forms involving modifications of the outer layer, changes in surface hydrophobicity and adhesive properties, increase in proteinase secretion and other metabolic transformations, are associated with the pathogenic behaviour of the fungus. Severity of the infectious process depends on the degree of immunological impairement of the host which leads to proliferation of the fungus. After recalling some aspects of the biodiversity of C. albicans, we present results concerning the adhesion of the fungus to various cellular and molecular host constituents such as epithelium, endothelium, complement components, fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin and entactin, as well as adhesion to catheters and other plastic prosthetic devices. A survey of Candida-secreted factors is followed a detailed review of host defense mechanisms. Non-specific by humoral and cellular factors, such as lactoferrin, polymorphonuclear cells, macrophages, NK cells, platelets and endothelial cells, are examined before considering more specific immune mechanisms involving antibodies, T gamma delta lymphocytes, Th1 and Th2 responses, and the role of cytokines.",,,"SENET, JM (通讯作者)，FAC PHARM ANGERS,16 BLVD DAVIERS,F-49100 ANGERS,FRANCE.",,,,,,,,0,6,7,0,5,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",1156-5233,,,J MYCOL MED,J.

We found that the slow damped motions of the positively charged residues of hHsp70 contribute the most to collective IR active modes at low frequencies (nu < 300 GHz). We predicted that different structural states and functional modes of large proteins, such as hHsp70, might be detected in the sub-THz frequency range by single-molecule spectroscopy similar to the recent extraordinary acoustic Raman spectroscopy (Wheaton, S.; et al.

Two sets of clusters are examined: the ground-state AlnPn clusters (n=2-9) and the prolate clusters (Al2P2)(N) and (Al3P3)(N) (N <= 6). In the ground-state clusters, the mean polarizability per atom, i.e., alpha/2n, decreases with the cluster size but shows peaks at n=5 and at n=7. We demonstrate that these peaks can be explained by a large polarizability of the Al atoms and by a low polarizability of the P atoms in Al5P5 and Al7P7 due to the presence of homopolar bonds in these clusters. We show indeed that the polarizability of an atom within an AlnPn cluster depends on the cluster size and the heteropolarity of the bonds it forms within the cluster, i.e., on the charges of the atoms. The polarizabilities of the fragments Al2P2 and Al3P3 in the prolate clusters were found to depend mainly on their location within the cluster. Finally, we show that the iterative Hirshfeld method is more suitable than the classic Hirshfeld method for describing the atomic polarizabilities and the atomic charges in clusters with heteropolar bonds, although both versions of the Hirshfeld method lead to similar conclusions.

The spatial and temporal records were transformed to the wavenunber-frequency domain, resulting in a three-dimensional (3-D) image power spectrum. In the spectrum, the signal energy of the waves is localized on a shell defined by the dispersion relation of surface waves. The sum of the sensor's velocity and the near-surface current profile deforms the dispersion shell due to the Doppler-frequency shift. An iterative least-squares fitting technique and an error-estimation model was implemented. To improve the method's accuracy, spectral wave energy found in higher harmonics of the dispersion shell and aliasing effects are taken into account. The most important nonlinear mechanism leading to higher harmonics is explained as resulting from wave shadowing due to the low grazing angles typical for ground-or ship-based radars. The low rotation time of nautical radar antennas causes temporal undersampling, which leads to aliasing in the frequency domain. In this paper, the improved method is examined analytically and is tested with Monte Carlo simulations. The variation of the shape of the measured or simulated 3-D image spectra, especially the peak wavenumber, the directional spread, and the main travel direction, controls the behavior and accuracy of the technique. A comparison of velocities acquired by nautical radar and independent Doppler Log current measurements is presented. The technique's accuracy, its limits, and its adaptability are discussed. Additional improvements are proposed, which lead to higher accuracy considering the shape of the spectral background noise and the technique's applicability to high ship speeds. The presented method is an important step toward operationalization of a commercial wave-monitoring system based on nautical radars.","GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Hydrophys, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany",,"Senet, CM (通讯作者)，GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Hydrophys, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",senet@gkss.de,,,,,,,21,148,159,1,16,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

This approximation can no longer be applied to very thin films as the concept of a bulk dielectric function-the only input required in this approach-breaks down when used for a slab of a few atomic planes. In this paper, a formalism is developed allowing microscopic calculations of the phonon surface response function relevant to specular EELS in the case of thin films of ionic materials. Two test cases are analyzed in some detail: CaF2(111) isolated films and RbF(001) layers on a thick Ge substrate. EELS spectra are obtained from shell-model, lattice-dynamical calculations for relaxed films and compared with the predictions of the dielectric approximation. It is shown that the dielectric approximation reproduces the essential features of the phonon response when the layer thickness exceeds 20-30 angstrom. However, even for films having that thickness, small contributions of microscopic surface phonons survive and these may not be negligible. It is shown, in particular, that the S2 surface microscopic phonon of RbF(001) is responsible for doubling the intensity of the loss structure in the region of the interface macroscopic Fuchs-Kliewer phonon predicted by the dielectric approximation in RbF/Ge.",,,"LAMBIN, P (通讯作者)，FAC UNIV NOTRE DAME PAIX,INST STUDIES INTERFACE SCI,RUE BRUXELLES 61,B-5000 NAMUR,BELGIUM.",,,"Lambin, Philippe/0000-0001-8051-042X",,,,,45,46,47,0,16,AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOC,COLLEGE PK,"ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA",1098-0121,,,PHYS REV B,Phys.

Among the results, we show how this Program and its professionals have developed an alternative to the classic psychosocial triads that breaks with the disciplinary fragmentations of social intervention. On the other hand, the team has been building particular ways of understanding and carrying out the work, which assume CSECY victimization as a violation, also linked to structural violence and class inequalities, creating a response of resignification from a Critical or Class Approach.

Its cause is probably toxic. The patients develop skin thickening, which is usually symmetrical on the limbs and sometimes extend to the trunk. Joint contractures and muscle sclerosis confine the patients to wheelchair. Systemic involvement may occur and includes cardiomyopathy, pulmonary fibrosis and diaphragmatic paralysis. The diagnosis is confirmed by the association of skin fibrosis and a cellular infiltration composed of CD34+ fibrocytes. Prognosis is severe with many deaths, rarely directly related to the disease. An improvement of lesions is possible, especially in case of resolution of the renal insufficiency. Several treatments have been evaluated, but none has shown consistent benefit. The toxic culprit is likely to be the gadolinium ions (Gd+++), released from some contrast agents used in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Evidence of the responsibility of Gd+++ is based on epidemiologic, biochemical and experimental data. Recommendations have been published for patients with renal insufficiency requiring a nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. If they are followed and efficient, it is likely that nephrogenic systemic sclerosis will disappear. (C) 2010 Societe nationale francaise de medecine interne (SNFMI).

The analysis technique allows the determination of hydrographic parameters, like the near-surface current velocity vector, the water depth, and fulldirectional calibrated wave spectra. After a geometric transformation of the image sequence from image coordinates to world coordinates the sequence is transformed to the three-dimensional wavenumber-frequency spectrum. Spectral filtering techniques allow a directional-frequency separation for each single wave of the sea-state signal. By an inverse transformation to the spatial domain noise-reduced phase and power maps of single waves are retrieved. The wavenumbers of these waves are determined by a fitting algorithm on a high-resoluted spatial scale. The composition of waves from all directions and frequencies results in a local wavenumber image spectrum. In-situ wave gauges at single points in the imaged area are used to calibrate the image spectra. This method is useful for impact studies on marine structures or beach studies in wave facilities. The analysis methods have been tested for optical sensors and as well for nautical X-band radar image sequences. This gives oceanographers, offshore, and coastal engineers a tool to study the spatio-temporal behaviour of complex wave fields in hydraulic wave tanks and in nature.","GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Hydrophys, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany",,"Senet, CM (通讯作者)，GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Hydrophys, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,0-7803-6359-0,INT GEOSCI REMOTE SE,,,2000.0,,,,,,,843,846,,,,,,4,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography; Remote Sensing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Physical Geography; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography; Remote Sensing,BT13Y,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000172046000277,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nanopore sensing is based on the measurement of variations in ionic current as charged biomolecules immersed in an electrolyte translocate through nanometer-sized channels, in response to an external voltage applied across the membrane. The passage of a biomolecule through a pore yields information about its structure and chemical properties, as demonstrated experimentally with sub-microsecond temporal resolution. However, extracting the sequence of a biomolecule without the information about its position remains challenging due to the fact there is a large variability of sensing events recorded. In this paper, we performed microsecond time scale all-atom non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of peptide translocation (motifs of alpha-synuclein, associated with Parkinson's disease) through single-layer MoS2 nanopores. First, we present an analysis based on the current threshold to extract and characterize meaningful sensing events from ionic current time series computed from MD. Second, a mechanism of translocation is established, for which side chains of each amino acid are oriented parallel to the electric field when they are translocating through the pore and perpendicular otherwise. Third, a new procedure based on the permutation entropy (PE) algorithm is detailed to identify protein sequence motifs related to ionic current drop speed. PE is a technique used to quantify the complexity of a given time series and it allows the detection of regular patterns. Here, PE patterns were associated with protein sequence motifs composed of 1, 2 or 3 amino acids. Finally, we demonstrate that this very promising procedure allows the detection of biological mutations and could be tested experimentally, despite the fact that reconstructing the sequence information remains unachievable at this time.","[Nicolai, Adrien; Rath, Aniket; Delarue, Patrice; Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 6303, 9 Av Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France",,"Nicolai, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 6303, 9 Av Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France.",adrien.nicolai@u-bourgogne.fr,"NICOLAÏ, Adrien/P-9026-2019","NICOLAI, Adrien/0000-0001-7779-4652","Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR); Directorate for Engineering of the National Science Foundation (NSF), Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Office [FA9550-17-1-0047]; EIPHI Graduate School [ANR-17EURE-0002]; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne FrancheComte; European Union through the PO FEDER-FSE Bourgogne 2014/2020 programs","Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); Directorate for Engineering of the National Science Foundation (NSF), Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Office(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); EIPHI Graduate School; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne FrancheComte(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte); European Union through the PO FEDER-FSE Bourgogne 2014/2020 programs","The simulations were performed using HPC resources from DSI-CCuB (Universite de Bourgogne).

In the present multinational double-blinded randomised controlled trial the effect of the two dressings were compared for treatment of venous leg ulcers. A total of 181 patients were treated for 6 weeks with either Biatain or Biatain-Ag followed by 4 weeks treatment with Biatain. Biatain-Ag showed superior performance in relative wound area reduction after 6 weeks treatment and the estimated treatment difference increased after 10 weeks indicating that the effect of silver continues at least for 4 weeks after treatment. A subgroup of the patients differed significantly from the others with respect to parameters associated with a poor healing prognosis; patients were older, had significant history of venous thrombosis, larger ulcers with longer duration and more often recurrent. For this subgroup of patients Biatain-Ag showed significant (P < 005) better performance in terms of relative ulcer area reduction and healing rate. In conclusion, this study suggests the superior performance of Biatain-Ag compared with the non silver-releasing dressing Biatain in particular for patients having ulcers associated with a poor healing prognosis.","[Senet, Patricia] Hop Tenon, AP HP, Dept Dermatol, UF Dermatol Vasc, F-75020 Paris, France; [Bause, Renzo] Hautmedizin, Ludenscheid, Germany; [Jorgensen, Bo] Bispebjerg Hosp, Copenhagen Wound Healing Ctr, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Fogh, Karsten] Dept Dermatol & Venereol, Dept Clin Med, Aarhus, Denmark",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Hop Tenon, AP HP, Dept Dermatol, UF Dermatol Vasc, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France.",patricia.senet@tnn.aphp.fr,,,"Coloplast A/S, Denmark","Coloplast A/S, Denmark","The authors would like to thank all the investigators for their contribution to the study.

In this context, a model for the potential energy relevant to an imaging electron encountering a carbon molecule is developed, The carbon atoms are characterized by static and dynamic polarizabilities to account for the effects of the static extraction bias and the moving imaging electrons. In agreement with previous papers, Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction are encountered. The C-60 molecule turns out to have a strong focusing effect near polarizability resonances. The simulations reveal that, below a given bias, little structural information is available in the potential-energy distribution, due td the large dynamic polarizability of the carbon atoms. Although this information is present for larger bias and appears in the local current density, the resolution of the technique (in its present form) is too limited for the atomic structure of the sample to appear in projected images.","Fac Univ Notre Dame Paix, Lab Phys Solide, B-5000 Namur, Belgium",,"Mayer, A (通讯作者)，Fac Univ Notre Dame Paix, Lab Phys Solide, Rue Bruxelles 61, B-5000 Namur, Belgium.",alexandre.mayer@undp.ac.be,,,,,,,30,25,26,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0953-8984,1361-648X,,J PHYS-CONDENS MAT,J.

The modulation introduces a spatio-temporal correlation of the sea clutter signal. A three-dimensional wavenumber frequency spectrum of the sea clutter is calculated from a time series of radar images with an FFT algorithm. Because of the non-linearity of the imaging process the image spectrum contains harmonics in addition to the linear fundamental mode. These modes are localized at distinct surfaces in the wave number frequency space corresponding to the scaled dispersion relation of surface gravity waves. Because of the localization of the spectral energy on dispersion shells, the aliasing effect due to a temporal undersampling can be overcome. The dispersion shells are reconstructed over the Nyquist frequency barrier and for negative frequencies. The dispersion shells are used as spectral filters to separate the modes from the clutter noise pedestal of radar image spectre. This pedestal shows the effect of the impulse response due to the finite spatial resolution of the radar. The spectral energy of the wavenumber frequency spectrum is integrated over the frequency coordinate axis, with the positive solution of the dispersion relation of surface gravity waves as signal Alter. With this spectral Alter method an unambiguous wave number image spectrum is selected. The fundamental image spectrum is related to the surface wave spectrum by an image transfer function. An empirical calibration procedure is presented. This procedure is based on the correlation of the signal to noise ratio with the significant wave height. The applicability of the method is shown using a radar and buoy data set. The spectral energies of fundamental mode, first harmonic, and the clutter component are compared. It was proved that the spectral energy of the clutter noise exceeds the spectral energy of the first harmonic mode by an order of magnitude, i.e. the physical background of the empirical calibration method is similar to the method well established for wave spectra from single SAR images.",,,"Seemann, J (通讯作者)，GKSS FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM GEESTHACHT GMBH,MAX PLANCK STR,D-21502 GEESTHACHT,GERMANY.",,,,,,,,0,22,24,0,0,I E E E,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017",,,0-7803-4108-2,,,,1997.0,,,,,,,1148,1154,,,,,,7,"Acoustics; Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Instruments & Instrumentation; Oceanography; Remote Sensing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Acoustics; Engineering; Geology; Instruments & Instrumentation; Oceanography; Remote Sensing,BJ68T,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:A1997BJ68T00200,View Full Record in Web of Science

The chaperone function of Hsp70 is based on an allosteric mechanism. Binding of ATP in NBD decreases the affinity of the substrate for SBD, and hydrolysis of ATP is promoted by binding of polypeptide segments in the SBD No complete structure of human Hsp70 is known Here, we report two models of human Hsp70, constructed by homology with Saccharomyces cerevisiae cochaperone protein Hsp110 (open model) and with Escherichia coli 70 kDa DnaK (closed model) and relaxed for several tens to hundreds of nanoseconds by using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent We obtain two stable states, Hsp70 with SBD open and SBD closed, which agree with experimental and structural information for ATP-Hsp70 and ADP-Hsp70, respectively. The dynamics of the transition from the open to closed states is investigated with a coarse-grained model and normal-mode analysis The results show that the conformational change between the two states can be represented by a relatively small number of collective modes which involved major conformational changes in the two domains These modes provide a mechanistic representation of the communication between NBD and SBD and allow us to identify subdomains and residues that appear to have a critical role in the conformational change mechanism that guides the chaperoning cycle of Hsp70.","[Nicolai, Adrien; Senet, Patrick; Delarue, Patrice] Univ Bourgogne, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 5209, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Ripoll, Daniel R.] Cornell Univ, Computat Biol Serv Unit, Cornell Theory Ctr, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 5209, 9 Av A Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France.",,"NICOLAÏ, Adrien/P-9026-2019",,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); HPC ressources of CINES [2009-c2009076161]; French Ministry of Research and Education,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); HPC ressources of CINES; French Ministry of Research and Education,"P S. thanks the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) for support (delegation CNRS) This research was conducted using the computational resources of the Centre de Ressources Informatiques (CRI), Universite de Bourgogne.

The spectral energy is localized on a shell defined by the surface wave dispersion relation. The sum of the sensor's velocity and the near surface current profile deforms the dispersion shell due to the Doppler frequency shift. An iterative least square fitting technique and an error estimation model has been implemented recently. Higher harmonics and aliasing effects are taken Into account to increase the method's accuracy. The most important nonlinear mechanism leading to higher harmonics can be explained by wave shadowing due to the low grazing angles typical for ground or ship based radars. Temporal undersampling leads to aliasing. Both effects result in additional signals which are used to increase the technique's accuracy. In this paper the technique is examined analytically and with Monte Carlo simulation runs. The variation of shape of the measured or simulated three dimensional spectra -especially the peak wavenumber, the directional spread, and the main travel direction -controls the behaviour and accuracy of the technique.

For the model of the harmonic oscillator, V(x) = 1/2x(2), this equation leads to a non-local kinetic energy functional in which only first-order derivatives of rho(x) enter. This example shows the usefulness of a new concept, the Pauli function, which encompasses the Pauli principle in terms of the electronic density. For the harmonic oscillator model, the kinetic energy can then be expressed exactly in terms of the Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy functional, together with the von Weizsacker inhomogeneity term, but now in a fully non-local way.

The case was studied using mixed methodologies, integrating various tools that mainly came together in an ethnography of the natural environment of the project. The study shows that the rights approach is articulated on a declaratory level and on a rather different practical one: a) the former can be aligned with human rights; b) the latter has two antagonistic forms: i) exo-efficacy and ii) personal values, but not self-efficacy. The study's conclusions include recommendations for the inclusion of the rights approach in child protection programs.","[Belen Ortega-Senet, Maria; Gomez Fernandez, Veronica Patricia; Bustamante Duran, Fernando] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile",,"Ortega-Senet, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.",belenmim@gmail.com; vegomez@ucsc.cl; fbustamante@ucsc.cl,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,0,"UNAM, FAC CIENCIAS POLITICAS & SOCIALES",MEXICO CITY DF,"CIUDAD UNIV, DIV ESTUDIOS POSGRADO, CIRCUITO MARIO DE LA CUEVA, MEXICO CITY DF, CP 04510, MEXICO",0185-1918,,,REV MEX CIENC POLIT,Rev.

This question is addressed by analyzing folding and nonfolding trajectories of a protein; as an example, the analysis is applied to the 37-residue triple beta-strand WW domain from the Formin binding protein 28 (FBP28) (PDB ID: 1E0L). Molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories were generated with the coarse-grained united-residue force field, and one- and two-dimensional free-energy landscapes (FELs) along the backbone virtual-bond angle theta and backbone virtual-bond-dihedral angle gamma of each residue and principal components, respectively, were analyzed. The key residues involved in the folding of the FBP28 WW domain are elucidated by this analysis. The correlations between local and global motions are found. It is shown that most of the residues in the folding trajectories of the system studied here move in a concerted fashion, following the dynamics of the whole system. This demonstrates how the choice of a pathway has to involve concerted movements in order for this protein to fold. This finding also sheds light on the effectiveness of principal component analysis (PCA) for the description of the folding dynamics of the system studied. It is demonstrated that the FEL along the PCs, computed by considering only several critically-placed residues, can correctly describe the folding dynamics.","[Maisuradze, Gia G.; Senet, Patrick; Scheraga, Harold A.] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Liwo, Adam] Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, PL-80952 Gdansk, Poland; [Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, F-21078 Dijon, France",,"Scheraga, HA (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",has5@cornell.edu,,"Liwo, Adam/0000-0001-6942-2226",National Institutes of Health [GM-14312]; National Science Foundation [MCB10-19767]; Direct For Biological Sciences [1019767] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [R01GM014312] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),"This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (GM-14312) and the National Science Foundation (MCB10-19767) and conducted by using the resources of (a) our 588-processor Beowulf cluster at the Baker Laboratory of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, (b) the National Science Foundation Terascale Computing System at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center, (c) the Beowulf cluster at the Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, (d) the Informatics Center of the Metropolitan Academic Network (IC MAN) in Gdansk, and (e) the Interdisciplinary Center of Mathematical and Computer Modeling (ICM) at the University of Warsaw.",,62,15,15,0,40,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

Features observed on the water surface are, e.g., wave fields or wind streaks. The acquisition and analysis of image sequences therefore allows a complete (spatio-temporal) representation of the sea state. Ship- or land-based nautical radars are used in the field and optical sensors are used in hydraulic wave tanks to acquire image sequences. A technique using a combination of image sequences acquired from CCD cameras and in-situ data sets is used to observe and analyze the spatiotemporal sea surface wave field in a hydraulic wave tank. A. new image sequence processing method, called DiSC (Dispersive Surface Classificator), was developed to create maps of physical parameters for inhomogeneous, dispersive surfaces. The analysis technique allows the determination and representation of hydrographic parameters such as the near-surface current-velocity vector, the water depth, and the full-directional wave spectra. DiSC, applied to image sequences of the sea surface, is useful for impact studies on maritime structures, beach studies, and other studies in wave facilities. The analysis method also has been tested for nautical X-band radar image sequences. The presented method enables oceanographers and offshore and coastal engineers to study the spatio-temporal behaviour of wave fields in nature and in hydraulic wave tanks for monitoring and planning purposes.","GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Hydrophys, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany",,"Senet, CM (通讯作者)，GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Hydrophys, Max Planck Str, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",,,,,,,,7,4,5,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,0-7803-6552-6,,,,2000.0,,,,,,,1769,1774,,,,,,6,"Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Civil; Oceanography",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Oceanography,BR32X,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000166107400276,View Full Record in Web of Science

For these H-bonded systems, we optimize the geometries and compute the dipole moments and polarizabilities using a supermolecule approach. The corresponding properties of the individual water molecules in the clusters are extracted from the molecular properties using the Hirshfeld expansion of the electronic density. Calculations at Hartree-Fock and second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2) levels are also presented for a comparison with the DFT results. The dependence of the dielectric properties on the cluster structure and size is given for both clusters and individual molecules and is compared with the available experimental data. The intermolecular interactions and their influences on the dielectric properties are discussed. The current results could serve to improve existing polarizable force fields for water.

The objective was to estimate the risk of cutaneous malignant transformation in SCD patients with prolonged leg ulcers or under HU therapy. Results In this cross-sectional study, the cohort consisted of 1543 patients. In the first series, 29 patients presented a total of 53 ulcers lasting more than two years. The median age was 35 +/- 8.4 years old. The median duration for a single ulcer was 9.2 +/- 7 years. None of the examined ulcers showed any suspicious area of malignant transformation. In the second series, 187 patients treated with HU for more than two years were identified. The median age was 31.3 +/- 9.9 years old. The median duration of treatment with HU was 6 +/- 3.2 years. No skin carcinoma or actinic keratosis was recorded. Conclusions This study showed that skin carcinogenesis did not occur in our series of SCD patients exposed to transforming events such as long term HU treatment or prolonged leg ulcers.","[Soutou, Boutros] Univ St Joseph, Fac Med, Beirut 166830, Lebanon; [Senet, Patricia] Hop Tenon, AP HP, Dept Dermatol, Paris, France; [Lionnet, Francois] Hop Tenon, AP HP, Dept Internal Med, Ctr Sickle Cell Dis, Paris, France; [Habibi, Anoosha] Hop Henri Mondor, AP HP, Unite Malad Genet Globule Rouge, Ctr Reference Syndromes Drepanocytaires Majeurs, Creteil, France; [Aractingi, Selim] Hop Cochin Tarnier, Serv Dermatol, Fac Med Paris 5 Descartes, Paris, France; [Aractingi, Selim] INSERM, UMR S 938, Equipe Cellules Souches Foetales, Paris, France",,"Soutou, B (通讯作者)，Univ St Joseph, Fac Med, Beirut 166830, Lebanon.",boutros.soutou@usj.edu.lb,"Soutou, Boutros/AIE-2194-2022","Soutou, Boutros/0000-0002-3906-7021",AREMPH,AREMPH,Authors wish to acknowledge AREMPH for supporting this work.,,41,2,2,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1750-1172,,ORPHANET J RARE DIS,Orphanet J.

The dielectric response of surface phonons to infra-red excitations is analysed with some details for two test cases: a SiO2(0001) self-supported film and NaCl(001) slabs on a thick Ge substrate. The results obtained from lattice-dynamics calculations for short wave vectors are compared with the predictions of electrostatics.

The vast majority of experiments in vitro and in vivo provide extensive evidence that a disordered monomeric form is the predominant state of alpha S in water solution, and it undergoes a large-scale disorder-to-helix transition upon binding to vesicles of different types. Recently, another form, tetrameric, of alpha S with a stable helical structure was identified experimentally. It has been shown that a dynamic intracellular population of metastable alpha S tetramers and monomers coexists normally; and the tetramer plays an essential role in maintaining alpha S homeostasis. Therefore, it is of interest to know whether the tetramer can serve as a means of preventing or delaying the start of PD. Before answering this very important question, it is, first, necessary to find out, on an atomistic level, a correlation between tetramers and monomers; what mediates tetramer formation and what makes a tetramer stable. We address these questions here by investigating both monomeric and tetrameric forms of alpha S. In particular, by examining correlations between the motions of the side chains and the main chain, steric parameters along the amino-acid sequence, and one- and two-dimensional free-energy landscapes along the coarse-grained dihedral angles gamma and delta and principal components, respectively, in monomeric and tetrameric alpha S, we were able to shed light on a fundamental relationship between monomers and tetramers, and the key residues involved in mediating formation of a tetramer. Also, the reasons for the stability of tetrameric alpha S and inability of monomeric alpha S to fold are elucidated here.","[Cote, Yoann] Univ Strasbourg, Inst Genet & Biol Mol & Cellulaire,CNRS, Dept Integrat Struct Biol,INSERM, UMR 7104,U964, 1 Rue Laurent Fries, F-67400 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Cote, Yoann; Delarue, Patrice; Senet, Patrick; Maisuradze, Gia G.] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, 9 Av Alain Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Scheraga, Harold A.; Senet, Patrick; Maisuradze, Gia G.] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Senet, P; Maisuradze, GG (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, 9 Av Alain Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France.;Senet, P; Maisuradze, GG (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",psenet@u-bourgogne.fr; gm56@cornell.edu,,,National Institutes of Health [GM-14312]; National Science Foundation [MCB10-19767]; PART NANO2BIO (Region Bourgogne Franche-Comte); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [R01GM014312] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); PART NANO2BIO (Region Bourgogne Franche-Comte); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),"This research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (GM-14312), the National Science Foundation (MCB10-19767), and the PART NANO2BIO (Region Bourgogne Franche-Comte).",,61,19,19,0,14,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1948-7193,,,ACS CHEM NEUROSCI,ACS Chem.

By using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the model alpha/beta protein VA3 in its native state, the coupling between the main-chain (MC) motions [represented by coarse-grained dihedral angles (CGDAs) gamma(n) based on four successive C-alpha atoms (n - 1, n, n + 1, n + 2) along the amino acid sequence] and its side-chain (SC) motions [represented by CGDAs delta(n) formed by the virtual bond joining two consecutive C-alpha atoms (n, n + 1) and the bonds joining these C-alpha atoms to their respective C-beta atoms] was analyzed. The motions of SCs (delta(n)) and MC (gamma(n)) over time occur on similar free-energy profiles and were found to be subdiffusive. The fluctuations of the SCs (delta(n)) and those of the MC (gamma(n)) are generally poorly correlated on a ps time-scale with a correlation increasing with time to reach a maximum value at about 10 ns. This maximum value is close to the correlation between the (delta(n))t and gamma(n)(t) time-series extracted from the entire duration of the MD runs (400 ns) and varies significantly along the amino acid sequence. High correlations between the SC and MC motions [delta(t) and gamma(t) time-series] were found only in flexible regions of the protein for a few residues which contribute the most to the slowest collective modes of the molecule. These results are a possible indication of the role of the flexible regions of proteins for the biological function and folding.","[Cote, Yoann; Senet, Patrick; Delarue, Patrice] Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Senet, Patrick; Maisuradze, Gia G.; Scheraga, Harold A.] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, 9 Ave A Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France.",psenet@u-bourgogne.fr; has5@cornell.edu,,,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Conseil Regional de Bourgogne; National Institutes of Health [GM-14312]; National Science Foundation [MCB10-19767]; Direct For Biological Sciences [1019767] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Conseil Regional de Bourgogne(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"Y.C. thanks the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and the Conseil Regional de Bourgogne for a PhD fellowship.

Clinical evaluation, skin swabs for bacterial and mycological cultures, patch testing and skin biopsy were performed at inclusion. This was followed by I month of topical antifungal cream and, if needed, by oral fluconazole for the second month. Results Forty-six patients were included (mean age 85 years). Causes of DD were established for 38 patients: 24 had candidiasis (63%), six irritant dermatitis (16%), four eczema (11%) and four psoriasis (11%). After 2 months of treatment, 27 of 37 (73%) patients were cured and five of 37 were improved.

Conversely, the tidal currents are influenced by changes in the bottom topography. The continuous observation of areas of high morphodynamic activity is important in order to warn of such changes in the flood stream situation and to avoid further change or loss of land. Therefore, there is urgent need for remote sensing methods which allow the retrieval of hydrographic parameters with high spatial resolution. Using a nautical X-band radar, image sequences of the water surface are acquired. The radar backscatter from the ocean surface is modulated by the surface wave field, and in addition in coastal areas by hydrodynamic interactions of the tidal current with the variable bottom topography. The bottom signatures are static during a single measurement, whereas the wave signature, whose spatio-temporal evolution is given by the dispersion relation of surface gravity waves, is dynamic. These signatures are separated by frequency filtering. A nautical X-band radar was mounted on the island of Sylt in the German Eight in the periods from February to June 1997 and from December 1998 to April 1999. The observed area is of high interest because morphological changes, altering the flood stream situation, have taken place in recent years and are still in progress. The static radar signatures have altered in a noticeable way between the two observation periods. A method was developed to estimate the near-surface current, the water depth and local surface-wave spectra from the dynamic radar signature, which is inhomogeneous in coastal areas due to the effects of wave refraction and diffraction, with high spatial resolution. The presented algorithm takes into account the inhomogeneities by using the local phase information of the imaged waves. As an example of the analysis, an image sequence taken during a storm surge on February 4, 1999, is used. The local wave spectra and maps of the water depth and the tidal current field are presented. The retrieved depth map is compared with echo soundings.","GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Hydrophys, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany",,"Seemann, J (通讯作者)，GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Hydrophys, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",seemann@gkss.de,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,0-7803-6551-8; 0-7803-6552-6,,,,2000.0,,,,,,,1329,1335,,,,,,7,"Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Civil; Oceanography",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Oceanography,BR32X,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000166107400206,View Full Record in Web of Science

It was first described in 1935 by Cornbleet. It involves increased thickness of the subcutaneous tissue of the scalp, responsible for an overall thickening of the scalp, which may be associated with alopecia, pruritus or painful sensations. Currently, fewer than 50 cases of lipedematous scalp, both with and without alopecia, have been reported in the literature. Patients and methods. - Herein we present the case of a 36-year-old woman from the Ivory Coast, who presented scalp pain associated with infiltration of the entire subcutaneous tissue of the scalp seen clinically and confirmed at MRI. Histology added nothing. Discussion. - We diagnosed a new case of lipedematous scalp in an African woman. No cause was found.

The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the prevalence of undiagnosed skin cancers among patients hospitalized in rehabilitation and long-term care units in a geriatric hospital. Patients and methods. - At( the patients, resident in four rehabilitation and tong-term care units and for whom no dermatological advice had been given, were systematically examined by a dermatologist. Clinical data included patient age at the time of the study, gender, relevant historical information, skin phototype and description of the cutaneous lesions. Biopsies were performed for at[ lesions of suspicious appearance. Results. - Three hundred and six patients (79.4% women and 20.6% men aged from 55 to 103 years) were included in the study. Among all the patients, 69.3% were hospitalized for more than one year. Skin phototype was clear for 93.5% of the patients. Thirty-two out of 306 patients (10.5%) presented 42 suspicious lesions and these were diagnosed by histological examination as 16 basal-cell carcinomas, seven squamous cell-carcinomas and two in situ melanomas. Skin cancers were localised on the head and neck in 80% of cases. The prevalence of patients with skin cancers was 5.6% in this population. Conclusion. - The prevalence of skin cancers among patients hospitalized in geriatric hospitals justifies improved training of geriatricians regarding early recognition and dermatological assessment of cutaneous tumours.

Objectives To compare nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) findings in CLE patients with or without digital involvement, and to compare capillaroscopic findings between CLE patients with digital lesions and DM patients. Methods Prospective monocentric study including CLE and DM patients. NFC was performed and standardized items were recorded. Results Fifty-one CLE patients and 10 DM patients with digital lesions were included. A scleroderma pattern was found in 6 patients (12%): in 5 out of 17 patients with digital lesions, compared with only 1 out of 34 patients without digital lesions (p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, CLE digital lesions and digital ulcerations were statistically associated with scleroderma pattern. CLE digital lesions were significantly associated with architectural disorganization (p = 0.0003) and capillary rarefaction (p = 0.0038). A scleroderma pattern was significantly more frequent in DM patients (80%) than in CLE patients with digital lesions (30%, p = 0.018). Capillaroscopic findings were not significantly different between CLE patients with digital lesions and DM patients. Conclusion Although scleroderma pattern is more frequent in DM patients than in CLE patients with digital lesions, NFC cannot formally distinguish CLE from DM.","[Monfort, Jean-Benoit; Chasset, Francois; Barbaud, Annick; Frances, Camille; Senet, Patricia] Sorbonne Univ, Hop Tenon, AP HP, Serv Dermatol & Allergol,Fac Med, F-75020 Paris, France",,"Monfort, JB (通讯作者)，Hop Tenon, Serv Dermatol & Allergol, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France.",jean-benoit.monfort@aphp.fr,", barbaud/AAZ-7250-2021","Monfort, Jean-Benoit/0000-0002-4792-2622",,,,,32,3,3,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0961-2033,1477-0962,,LUPUS,Lupus,JUL,2021.0,30,8,,,,,1207,1213,9612033211010328,10.1177/09612033211010329,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09612033211010329,,APR 2021,7,Rheumatology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Rheumatology,SS7OF,33853419.0,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000649069700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The new three-dimensional (3D) LifeViz digital imaging system (QuantifiCare S.A., Valbonne, France) combines a compact, easy to use stereovision camera and image management software to provide 3D medical images. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether the 3D LifeViz digital imaging system could be considered a suitable alternative to manual transparent wound tracing for the measurement of VLU area and 4-week healing rates. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in two tertiary centers between November 2013 and January 2014. The intrarater variability of the digital imaging system was assessed by comparison of the target wound (TVV) areas obtained at the inclusion visit (WO) and 2 days after WO for each local rater. The inter-rater variability of the two methods at WO and the study end visit was assessed using the TVV area measurements obtained by local and central raters. Results: A total of 36 consecutive outpatients, each presenting with at least one VLU and representing a total of 44 TVVs, were recruited. At inclusion, comparable results were observed with both methods in terms of mean VLU area, showing a good correlation of the digital imaging method with the transparent tracing method (concordance correlation coefficient [CCC], 0.989; 95% confidence interval [C], 0.983-0.992). Furthermore, this system detected the same changes in the 4-week healing rate as the transparent tracing method, showing that both methods were equivalent in measuring changes in VLU areas over time (CCC, 0.996; 95% CI, 0.994-0.997). Strong intrarater and inter-rater concordances demonstrated good reproducibility of the digital imaging system for VLU area measurements (CCC 0.994 (95% CI, 0.992-0.995] for intrarater variability; and CCC >= 0.99 for each center for inter-rater variability). Moreover, regardless of the operator measuring the VLUs, the reliability of image capture and image quality remained excellent. Conclusions: The 3D LifeViz digital imaging system is a noncontact stereophotographic method that provides measurements of VLU area or changes in VLU areas that are as accurate and reliable as those obtained using the planimetry method and in conditions as close as possible to those of a clinical trial.","[Chaby, Guillaume; Lok, Catherine] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, Serv Dermatol, Hop Nord, Amiens, France; [Thirion, Jean Philippe] QuantifiCare SA, Valbonne, France; [Lucien, Arnaud] Inst Rech Int Servier, Suresnes, France; [Senet, Patricia] Hop Tenon, AP HP, Serv Dermatol, Paris, France",,"Lok, C (通讯作者)，Hop Nord Amiens, Serv Dermatol, Pl Victor Pauchet, F-80054 Amiens, France.",lok.catherine@chu-amiens.fr,,,Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier,Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier(Servier),This study was funded by Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier in 2013.,,21,4,6,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-333X,,,J VASC SURG-VENOUS L,J.

Higher crack growth resistance and fracture toughness of the longer fibre composite are attributed to the enhanced fibre pull-out and fibre bridging in the following wake region. The relative contribution from the frontal and following wake zone is determined experimentally by the use of renotching methods which demonstrate the effectiveness of the traction zone behind the crack tip.

We report the case of a patient presenting cutaneous limited SSc associated with CD30 anaplastic lymphoma with cutaneous and lymph node involvement in whom the capillaroscopic scleroderma pattern regressed completely after autologous bone marrow transplantation, with complete remission of the lymphoma. Case report. - A 37-year-old man presented bilateral Raynaud's phenomenon associated with digital ulcers contracted one year earlier but subsequently neglected. Right axillary lymph nodes and regional cutaneous tumors were present, leading to the diagnosis of CD30+ anaplastic lymphoma with cutaneous and lymph node involvement. Chemotherapy containing cyclophosphamide achieved only partial remission of the lymphoma. Clinical examination showed bilateral Raynaud's phenomenon, sclerodactyly, a right axillary subcutaneous nodule and a pathological Allen's test for the right hand. Antinuclear antibodies were positive without any other immunological abnormalities, and capillaroscopy showed an SSc pattern with numerous megacapillaries. Digital blood pressure was reduced in the right index and the left middle fingers, in which ulcers of the pulp were observed. Bone marrow transplantation was performed, resulting in complete remission of the lymphoma and disappearance of the sclerodactyly, with no recurrence of the pulp ulcers and complete normalization of capillaroscopic appearance and digital pressure. Discussion. - This case raises the question of authentic SSc and neoplasia and highlights the importance of capillaroscopy in the follow-up of SSc. The complete regression of SSc and of capillaroscopic abnormalities could be explained by the paraneoplastic nature of SSc or by the direct action of the chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation.

In this article, we describe the use of the physics-based united-residue (UNRES) force field, developed in our laboratory, in protein-structure simulations. We demonstrate that this force field offers about a 4000-times extension of the simulation time scale; this feature arises both from averaging out the fast-moving degrees of freedom and reduction of the cost of energy and force calculations compared to all-atom approaches with explicit solvent. With massively parallel computers, microsecond folding simulation times of proteins containing about 1000 residues can be obtained in days. A straightforward application of canonical UNRES/MD simulations, demonstrated with the example of the N-terminal part of the B-domain of staphylococcal protein A (PDB code: 1BDD, a three-alpha-helix bundle), discerns the folding mechanism and determines kinetic parameters by parallel simulations of several hundred or more trajectories. Use of generalized-ensemble techniques, of which the multiplexed replica exchange method proved to be the most effective, enables us to compute thermodynamics of folding and carry out fully physics-based prediction of protein structure, in which the predicted structure is determined as a mean over the most populated ensemble below the folding-transition temperature. By using principal component analysis of the UNRES folding trajectories of the formin-binding protein WW domain (PDB code: 1EOL; a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet) and 1BDD, we identified representative structures along the folding pathways and demonstrated that only a few (low-indexed) principal components can capture the main structural features of a protein-folding trajectory; the potentials of mean force calculated along these essential modes exhibit multiple minima, as opposed to those along the remaining modes that are unimodal.

Nutritional deficiencies may delay the wound healing process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of protein malnutrition in patients presenting with a leg ulcers and to determine which clinical data can predict malnutrition on population. Patients and methods. This prospective survey included community patients, hospitalized in rehabilitation care unit for treatment of a leg ulcer unhealed for at least 3 months. Clinical, anthropometric and biological data were collected on admission. Results. Sixty-six patients, mean age 72.9 +/- 16.3 years, were included. Fifty-three p. 100 presented wound surfaces over 30 cm(2); 59 P. 100 of the ulcers had lasted for more than one year; 62 p. 100 of the ulcers were venous. 48.5 p. 100 of the patients exhibited protein malnutrition defined by biological criteria, associated with an inflammatory syndrome in 66 p. 100. Anemia and an inflammatory syndrome were present in respectively 59 and 58 p. 100 of the patients. Neither anthropometric measurements nor nutritional intake or wound characteristics significantly differenced between patients with malnutrition or not. Hypoalbuminemia was significantly more frequent and severe in patients aged over 70. Discussion. Protein malnutrition prevalence is very high in patients with leg ulcers, particularly in the elderly. Since nutritional interview or clinical data failed to predict protein malnutrition, systematic biological assessment is justified in all patients with leg ulcers.","Hop Charles Foix, Serv Gerontol 5, F-94205 Ivry, France; Hop Broussais, Serv Reeduc Vasc, F-75014 Paris, France",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Hop Charles Foix, Serv Gerontol 5, Pavillon Orbe, F-94205 Ivry, France.",patricia.senet@cfx.ap-hop-paris.fr,,,,,,,22,5,5,0,4,MASSON EDITEUR,MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9,"21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE",0151-9638,2214-5451,,ANN DERMATOL VENER,Ann.

Similarity is also an important concept in computational biology to measure the exchangeability of an amino acid by another in a protein sequence. In the present work, a distance between two molecules based on local and global softnesses of their fragments is defined. The method proposed is general and could be applied to any molecular library. It is first applied to compute the distance between the 190 pairs of different amino acids in their neutral states. Two amino acids belonging to the one of the biochemical class (aliphatic, sulfur-containing, acidic,...) are found to be at a smaller distance than two amino acids belonging to two different classes. A first attempt to relate this ab anti distance to the substitution matrix used in computational biology is presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A method was developed to estimate the near-surface current, the water depth and calibrated surface wave spectra from nautical radar image sequences. The algorithm is based on the three-dimensional Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) of the spatio-temporal sea clutter pattern in the wavenumber-frequency domain. The dispersion relation is used to define a filter to separate the spectral signal of the imaged waves from the background noise component caused by speckle noise. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) contains information about the significant wave height. The method has been proved to be reliable for the analysis of homogeneous water surfaces in offshore installations. Radar images are inhomogeneous because of the dependency of the image transfer function (ITF) on the azimuth angle between the wave propagation and the antenna viewing direction. The inhomogeneity of radar imaging is analyzed using image sequences of a homogeneous deep-water surface sampled by a ship-borne radar. Changing water depths in shallow-water regions induce horizontal gradients of the tidal current. Wave refraction occurs due to the spatial variability of the current and water depth. These areas cannot be investigated with the standard method. A new method, based on local wavenumber estimation with the multiple-signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, is outlined. The MUSIC algorithm provides superior wavenumber resolution on local spatial scales. First results, retrieved from a radar image sequence taken from an installation at a coastal site, are presented.","GKSS Res Ctr, Inst Hydrophys, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany",,"Seemann, J (通讯作者)，GKSS Res Ctr, Inst Hydrophys, Max Planck Str, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",,,,,,,,22,3,3,0,0,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,,0-8194-3294-6,P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS,,,1999.0,3808,,,,,,536,546,,10.1117/12.365865,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.365865,,,11,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Optics,BN98Z,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000083768500051,View Full Record in Web of Science

Atomistic simulations based on interatomic potentials and minimisation techniques have been used to determine the location of the cations as a function of the Si/Al ratio and the hydration level. Our calculations showed two different cation behaviours depending on the type of channels that they occupy, the positions of the cations in the main channels being substantially perturbed upon the sorption of water molecules whereas those of the cations located in the small side channels being only slightly shifted. By contrast, the populations of the cation sites have almost the same trend when the Si/Al ratio varies. We have then developed a Monte Carlo technique specialised for the simulation of rare events to study the activated cations motions in this zeolite. Mean activation barriers are obtained from minimum energy paths (MEP) calculated for lattices with various Si/Al ratio, by using a Metropolis algorithm. Finally, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations allowed us to compare the mobility of the cations in hydrated and dehydrated states and confirmed the results expected from the previous static calculations. This modelling has been successfully compared with experimental data obtained by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) and provided a microscopic description of the static and dynamic properties of the extra-framework cations.","Univ Aix Marseille 1, Ctr St Jerome, UMR 6121 CNRS, Lab Madirel, F-13397 Marseille 20, France; UCL Royal Inst Great Britain, Davy Faraday Res Lab, London W1S 4BS, England; Univ Bourgogne, Fac Sci Mirande, UMR 5027 CNRS, Phys Lab, F-21078 Dijon, France; Univ Montpellier 2, Lab Physicochim Mat Condensee, UMR 5617 CNRS, F-34095 Montpellier, France",,"Maurin, G (通讯作者)，Univ Aix Marseille 1, Ctr St Jerome, UMR 6121 CNRS, Lab Madirel, Av Escadrille Normandie Niemen, F-13397 Marseille 20, France.",maurin@up.univ-mrs.fr,"MAURIN, Guillaume GM/G-7435-2015; Devautour-vinot, Sabine/V-9727-2018; Bell, Robert G/C-4007-2008","MAURIN, Guillaume GM/0000-0002-2096-0450; Devautour-vinot, Sabine/0000-0002-3812-7379; ",,,,,26,4,5,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0892-7022,,,MOL SIMULAT,Mol.

Here, the analytical LifsonRoig model for the helixcoil transition is modified to analyze local thermal unfolding of the fast-folder W protein of bacteriophage lambda (gpW) simulated by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent at 15 different temperatures. The protein structure is described by the coarse-grained dihedral angles (gamma) and bond angles (theta) built between successive (CC alpha)-C-alpha virtual bonds. Each (gamma,theta) pair serves as a local probe of protein unfolding. Local native/non-native states are defined for each pair of (gamma,theta) angles by analyzing the free-energy landscapes Delta G(gamma,theta) computed from MD trajectories. The three local elementary equilibrium constants of the model are extracted for each (gamma,theta) pair along the sequence from MD simulations, and the model predictions are compared to the MD data. Using only the local equilibrium constants as an input, we show that the local denaturation curves computed from the model partition function fit their MD simulated counterparts in a satisfying manner without any adjustment. In the model and MD simulations, gpW unfolds gradually between 320 and 340 K, with an average native percentage decreasing from 0.8 (320 K) to 0.2 (340 K). In the prism of the model, there is no stable structure at the local scale in this 20 K unfolding temperature range. The enthalpy change upon local unfolding computed from the model and from MD trajectories suggests that the unfolded state between 320 and 340 K corresponds to a dynamical equilibrium between a large ensemble of constantly changing structures. The present results confirm the downhill unfolding of gpW, which does not obey a two-state global folding/unfolding model, and shed light on the interpretation of local denaturation curves.","[Grassein, Paul; Delarue, Patrice; Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne FrancheComte, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, 9 Av Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Scheraga, Harold A.; Maisuradze, Gia G.; Senet, Patrick] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne FrancheComte, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, 9 Av Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France.;Scheraga, HA; Maisuradze, GG; Senet, P (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",has5@cornell.edu; gm56@comell.edu; psenet@u-bourgogne.fr,,,National Institutes of Health [R01GM14312]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [R01GM014312] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)),Calculations were performed using HPC resources from PSIUN CCUB (Centre de Calcul de l'Universite de Bourgogne).

The angular distributions are dominated by sharp hexagonal (1x1) diffraction peaks characteristic of a full bilayer terminated ice Ih crystal. Additional, very broad and weak, p(2.1x2.1) peaks may indicate the presence of small domains of antiphase oriented molecules. An eikonal analysis of the 1x1 peaks is compatible with either a proton disordered or a proton ordered surface with corrugations of 0.76 Angstrom and 0.63 Angstrom, respectively. Inelastic time-of-flight spectra reveal not only a dispersionless phonon branch reported previously at 5.9 meV, but also the first evidence for the surface Rayleigh phonons, which are reproduced well by a Born-von Karman simulation of a full bilayer terminated ice surface using the unmodified force constants derived from neutron scattering bulk phonon measurements. Since the lattice dynamics simulations do not reproduce the dispersionless branch, it is attributed to the vibrations of single water molecules on the ice surface.

To understand how the main chain in the native state of a protein fluctuates on different time scales, we examined the rotational correlation functions (RCFs), C(t), of the backbone N-H bonds and of the dihedral angles gamma built on four consecutive C-alpha atoms. Using molecular dynamics simulations of a model alpha/beta protein (VA3) in its native state, we demonstrate that these RCFs decay as stretched exponentials, In [C(t)]approximate to D(alpha)t(alpha) with a constant D-alpha and an exponent alpha (0<alpha<0.35) varying with the free-energy profiles (FEPs) along the amino acid sequence. The probability distributions of the fluctuations of the main chain computed at short time scale (1 ps) were identical to those computed at large time scale (1 ns) if the time is rescaled by a factor depending on alpha<1. This self-similar property and the nonexponential decays (alpha not equal 1) of the RCFs are described by a rotational diffusion equation with a time-dependent diffusion coefficient D(t)=alpha D(alpha)t(alpha-1). The present findings agree with observations of subdiffusion (alpha<1) of fluorescent probes within a protein molecule. The subdiffusion of N-15-H bonds did not affect the value of the order parameter S-2 extracted from the NMR relaxation data by assuming normal diffusion (alpha=1) of N-15-H bonds on a nanosecond time scale. However, we found that the RCF does not converge to S-2 on the nanosecond time scale for residues with multiple-minima FEPs.","[Cote, Yoann; Senet, Patrick; Delarue, Patrice] Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 5209, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Senet, Patrick; Maisuradze, Gia G.; Scheraga, Harold A.] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 5209, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, 9 Ave Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France.",psenet@u-bourgogne.fr; has5@cornell.edu,,,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Conseil Regional de Bourgogne; CNRS; National Institutes of Health [GM-14312]; National Science Foundation [MCB05-41633],Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Conseil Regional de Bourgogne(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte); CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)European Commission); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Y.C. thanks the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and the Conseil Regional de Bourgogne for a PhD fellowship.

SSN sequencing is based on measuring the variations in ionic conductance as charged biomolecules translocate through nanometer-sized channels, in response to an external voltage applied across the membrane. Although several experiments on DNA translocation through SSNs have been performed in the past decade, translocation of proteins has been less studied, partly due to small protein size and detection limits. Moreover, the threading of proteins through nanopore channels is challenging, because proteins can exhibit neutral global charge and not be sensitive to the electric field. In this paper, we investigate the translocation of lysine residues and a model protein with polylysine tags through MoS2 nanoporous membranes using molecular dynamics simulations. Adding lysine tags to biological peptides is the method proposed here to promote the entrance of proteins through SSN. Specifically, we study the relationship existing between the translocation events and the ionic conductance signal drops. We show that individual lysine residues translocate easily through MoS2 nanopores, but the translocation speed is extremely fast, which leads to indiscernible ionic conductance drops. To reduce the translocation speed, we demonstrate that increasing the thickness of the membrane from single-layer to bilayer MoS2 reveals a step-wise process of translocation with discernible conductance drops that could be measured experimentally. Finally, a study of the threading of proteins with polylysine tags through MoS2 nanopores is presented. The addition of the positively charged tag to the neutral protein allows the threading and full translocation of the protein through the pore (at least two lysine residues are necessary in this case to observe translocation) and a similar sequence of translocation events is detected, independently of the tag length.","[Nicolai, Adrien; Perez, Maria Daniela Barrios; Delarue, Patrice; Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, UMR 6303, 9 Av A Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Meunier, Vincent] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Phys Appl Phys & Astron, 110 Eighth St, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Drndic, Marija] Univ Penn, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Nicolai, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, UMR 6303, 9 Av A Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France.",adrien.nicolai@u-bourgogne.fr,"Meunier, Vincent/F-9391-2010; NICOLAÏ, Adrien/P-9026-2019","Meunier, Vincent/0000-0002-7013-179X; NICOLAI, Adrien/0000-0001-7779-4652","Air Force Office of Scientific Research; Directorate for Engineering of the National Science Foundation (NSF), Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Office [FA9550-17-1-0047]; NSF [EFRI 2-DARE (EFRI-1542707)]; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne-Franche-Comte [ANER NANOSEQ]","Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); Directorate for Engineering of the National Science Foundation (NSF), Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Office; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Conseil Regional de Bourgogne-Franche-Comte(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte)","The simulations were performed using HPC resources from DSI-CCuB (Universite de Bourgogne).

Missense mutations are associated with familial forms of this neuropathy. How these single amino-acid substitutions modify the conformations of wild-type alpha-synuclein is unclear. Here, using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we sampled the conformational space of the wild type and mutants (A30P, A53P, and E46K) of alpha-synuclein monomers for an effective time scale of 29.7 ms. To characterize the structures, we developed an algorithm, CUTABI (CUrvature and Torsion based of Alpha-helix and Beta-sheet Identification), to identify residues in the alpha-helix and beta-sheet from C-alpha -coordinates. CUTABI was built from the results of the analysis of 14,652 selected protein structures using the Dictionary of Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP) algorithm. DSSP results are reproduced with 93% of success for 10 times lower computational cost. A two-dimensional probability density map of alpha-synuclein as a function of the number of residues in the alpha-helix and beta-sheet is computed for wild-type and mutated proteins from molecular dynamics trajectories. The density of conformational states reveals a two-phase characteristic with a homogeneous phase (state B, beta-sheets) and a heterogeneous phase (state HB, mixture of alpha-helices and beta-sheets). The B state represents 40% of the conformations for the wild-type, A30P, and E46K and only 25% for A53T. The density of conformational states of the B state for A53T and A30P mutants differs from the wild-type one. In addition, the mutant A53T has a larger propensity to form helices than the others. These findings indicate that the equilibrium between the different conformations of the alpha-synuclein monomer is modified by the missense mutations in a subtle way. The alpha-helix and beta-sheet contents are promising order parameters for intrinsically disordered proteins, whereas other structural properties such as average gyration radius, R ( g ), or probability distribution of R ( g ) cannot discriminate significantly the conformational ensembles of the wild type and mutants. When separated in states B and HB, the distributions of R ( g ) are more significantly different, indicating that global structural parameters alone are insufficient to characterize the conformational ensembles of the alpha-synuclein monomer.","[Guzzo, Adrien; Delarue, Patrice; Nicolai, Adrien; Senet, Patrick] UMR 6303 CNRS Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, Dijon, France; [Rojas, Ana] Schrodinger Inc, New York, NY USA; [Maisuradze, Gia G.; Senet, Patrick] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，UMR 6303 CNRS Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, Dijon, France.;Senet, P (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",psenet@u-bourgogne.fr,"NICOLAÏ, Adrien/P-9026-2019",,EIPHI Graduate School [ANR-17-EUR-0002]; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte; European Union; National Institutes of Health [R01GM14312],EIPHI Graduate School; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte); European Union(European Commission); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"The calculations were performed using HPC resources from DSI-CCuB (Centre de Calcul de lUniversite de Bourgogne).

Design: Randomized, double-blind, parallel-assignment, controlled study. Setting: Ambulatory or hospitalized patients from 17 dermatology departments. Patients: Among 64 consecutive randomized patients with 1 or more hypertensive leg ulcers who fulfilled all inclusion criteria, 59 received the allocated intervention, and findings were analyzed. Intervention: Becaplermin gel (human recombinant platelet-derived growth factor-BB, 0.1%, in hydrogel) or hydrogel dressing was applied, both in doses of 1 cm/cm(2), once daily for 8 weeks. Follow-up continued for 4 weeks beyond the final gel application. Main Outcome Measures: The primary end point was complete wound closure rate after 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary end points were percentages of patients with complete wound closure at week 12; changed ulcer area after treatment vs baseline; and changed ulcer-related pain and health-related quality of life during the study. Results: Complete wound closure rates were comparable after 8 weeks for becaplermin (5 of 28 patients) and hydrogel (3 of 31 patients) (8 percentage-point difference; 95% confidence interval, -10% to 26%). No statistically significant differences were observed between the 2 groups for percentages of complete closure at week 12, changed ulcer area at week 8, or changed ulcer-related pain and quality of life during the study (P > .05 for all comparisons). Conclusions: Topical becaplermin gel is not superior to hydrogel dressing for hypertensive leg ulcer wound closure. Surgical management by grafting remains the most promising treatment strategy but requires further evaluation.","[Senet, Patricia] Hop Tenon, AP HP, Serv Dermatol, Dept Dermatol, F-75970 Paris 20, France; [Vicaut, Eric] Univ Paris, Hop Fernand Widal, AP HP, Unite Rech Clin, F-75252 Paris, France; [Beneton, Nathalie] Ctr Hosp Univ, Dept Dermatol, Le Mans, France; [Debure, Clelia] Hop Corentin Celton, AP HP, Dept Vasc Rehabil, Issy Les Moulineaux, France; [Lok, Catherine] Hop Nord Amiens, Dept Dermatol, Amiens, France; [Chosidow, Olivier] Hop Henri Mondor, AP HP, Dept Dermatol, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Chosidow, Olivier] UPEC Univ Paris Est, Val De Marne, France",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Hop Tenon, AP HP, Serv Dermatol, Dept Dermatol, 4 Rue Chine, F-75970 Paris 20, France.",patricia.senet@tnn.aphp.fr,,,Johnson Johnson; AP-HP; French Society of Dermatology; AFSSAPS (Agence Francaise de Securite Sanitaire des Produits de Sante),Johnson Johnson(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USA); AP-HP; French Society of Dermatology; AFSSAPS (Agence Francaise de Securite Sanitaire des Produits de Sante),"Dr Chosidow received consulting fees from Johnson & Johnson that did not concern wound care products.; This study was supported in part by AP-HP, the French Society of Dermatology, and the AFSSAPS (Agence Francaise de Securite Sanitaire des Produits de Sante).provided the becaplermin gel (Regranex Gel).",,23,34,34,1,2,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0003-987X,1538-3652,,ARCH DERMATOL,Arch.

A consequence of this fact is the uncertainty of the correctness of the maximum wave height in a time period and of extreme waves at all. A first approach method has been developed considering some physically motivated single-wave features.

Using in vitro assays, it was demonstrated that the yeast - mycelium transition was an important phenomenon in the acquisition of adhesive properties. Proteins with MWs of 60, 68, 200 and > 200 kDa seemed to be involved in germ tube adherence to plastic surfaces. Likewise, recent investigations have revealed that C. albicans expresses on its surface receptors which interact with a wide variety of host proteins, particularly some extracellular matrix components like fibronectin, laminin and collagen. Plasmatic components, such as fibrinogen, iC3b and C3d, have also been proposed as mediators of adherence of C. albicans. Thus, by their reaction with laminin, fibrinogen and C3d, the mannoproteins of 68 and 60 kDa demonstrated multiple biological activities. Proteins of similar MWs were detected as C3d and iC3b receptors, the latter showing similarities with the neutrophil CR3. Based upon the antigenic, structural and functional homologies between the candidal receptors and mammalian integrins, it was postulated that these fungal cell adhesion molecules (F-CAM) are members of the integrin family.

Using a nautical X-band radar image sequences of the water surface are acquired. The bottom signatures are static during a single measurement, whereas the wave signature, whose spatio-temporal evolution is given by the dispersion relation of surface gravity waves, is dynamic. These signatures are separated by frequency filtering. The analysis of the static radar signatures is performed in order to detect long term changes of the bathymetry. A nautical X-band radar was mounted on the island of Sylt in the German Bight in the period from February to June 1997, and from December 1998 to April 1999. The observed area is of high interest because morphological changes. The static radar signatures have altered in a noticeable way between the two observation periods. A method was developed to estimate the near-surface current, the water depth and calibrated surface wave spectra from the dynamic radar signature, with is inhomogeneous in coastal areas due to the effects of wave refraction and diffraction.

Toxic alpha-synuclein aggregates are the molecular hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. In vitro studies showed that alpha-synuclein aggregates in oligomeric structures of several 10th of monomers and into cylindrical structures (fibrils), comprising hundred to thousands of proteins, with polymorphic cross-beta-sheet conformations. Oligomeric species, formed at the early stage of aggregation remain, however, poorly understood and are hypothezised to be the most toxic aggregates. Here, we studied the formation of wild-type (WT) and mutant (A30P, A53T, and E46K) dimers of alpha-synuclein using coarse-grained molecular dynamics. We identified two principal segments of the sequence with a higher propensity to aggregate in the early stage of dimerization: residues 36-55 and residues 66-95. The transient alpha-helices (residues 53-65 and 73-82) of alpha-synuclein monomers are destabilized by A53T and E46K mutations, which favors the formation of fibril native contacts in the N-terminal region, whereas the helix 53-65 prevents the propagation of fibril native contacts along the sequence for the WT in the early stages of dimerization. The present results indicate that dimers do not adopt the Greek key motif of the monomer fold in fibrils but form a majority of disordered aggregates and a minority (9-15%) of pre-fibrillar dimers both with intra-molecular and intermolecular beta-sheets. The percentage of residues in parallel beta-sheets is by increasing order monomer < disordered dimers < pre-fibrillar dimers. Native fibril contacts between the two monomers are present in the NAC domain for WT, A30P, and A53T and in the N-domain for A53T and E46K. Structural properties of pre-fibrillar dimers agree with rupture-force atomic force microscopy and single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer available data. This suggests that the pre-fibrillar dimers might correspond to the smallest type B toxic oligomers. The probability density of the dimer gyration radius is multi-peaks with an average radius that is 10 & ANGS; larger than the one of the monomers for all proteins. The present results indicate that even the elementary alpha-synuclein aggregation step, the dimerization, is a complicated phenomenon that does not only involve the NAC region.","[Guzzo, Adrien; Delarue, Patrice; Nicolai, Adrien; Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 6303, Dijon, France; [Rojas, Ana] Schrodinger Inc, New York, NY USA; [Maisuradze, Gia G.; Senet, Patrick] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 6303, Dijon, France.;Senet, P (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",psenet@u-bourgogne.fr,"NICOLAÏ, Adrien/P-9026-2019",,EIPHI Graduate School [ANR-17-EUR-0002]; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte; European Union through the PO FEDER-FSE Bourgogne 2014/2020 programs; National Institutes of Health [R01GM14312],EIPHI Graduate School; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte); European Union through the PO FEDER-FSE Bourgogne 2014/2020 programs; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"The calculations were performed using HPC resources from DSI-CCuB (Centre de Calcul de l'Universite de Bourgogne) and 588-processor Beowulf cluster at the Baker Laboratory of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University.

High and continuous wind speeds, as well as remoteness to populated areas are advantages of offshore wind turbines. To evaluate the environmental sustainability and technical/financial feasibility of offshore wind farm expansion, the German Federal Government has decided to encourage the renewable offshore sector, among other things, with a comprehensive scientific research project (Research at Alpha Ventus (RAVE)) [1]. The RAVE project startet 2008 with first marine observations 2010. Purpose of this project is to enhance the sparely investigated knowledge of impacts of the harsh marine conditions with regard to construction and operation in offshore regions. Within this project, extensive oceanographic investigations are carried out. The measured oceanographic data is a basic dataset to the entire accompanying research, both for the technical aspects as for the environmental and geological investigations. Furthermore the influences of offshore structures and facilities should be examined with respect to shelf sea physics and vice versa. The present study shows results from five years of oceanographic measurements regarding to construction and operation of offshore wind farms. For that reason the focus is on sea state observations (installation, maintenance and data analysis) which have a major impact on the operational management of offshore facilities. In this paper, measurements with directional wave rider buoys, various radar level gauges (sea state parameters calculated from water level data) and ADCPs (with option to measure sea state) are compared and evaluated to their physical limits, ambient conditions, accuracies, as well as technical advantages and disadvantages. A better understanding of the instruments helps to optimize the measurement concepts in terms of type, number, measurement time and locations. In consequence this can lead to an improvement of offshore energy production facility design, robustness and dimensioning. Additional benefits can be an optimization of facility locations and access times during facility construction and maintenance, cost reduction as well as improved energy production rates.","[Fischer, Jens-G.; Senet, Christian; Schneehorst, Anja; Outzen, Olaf; Schirmel, Sebastian; Herklotz, Kai] Fed Maritime & Hydrog Agcy, Bernhard Nocht Str 78, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany",,"Fischer, JG (通讯作者)，Fed Maritime & Hydrog Agcy, Bernhard Nocht Str 78, D-20359 Hamburg, Germany.",jens.fischer@bsh.de,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4799-8419-0,,,,2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation; Water Resources",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation; Water Resources,BF1PY,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000380426700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This conjugation reaction, which occurs spontaneously but is dramatically accelerated by the enzyme, protects cells against damages caused by harmful molecules. With some exceptions, GSTs are catalytically active as homodimers, with monomers generally constituted of 200 to 250 residues organized into two subdomains. The first is the N-terminal subdomain, which contains an active site named G site, where GSH is hosted in catalytic conformation and which is generally highly conserved among GSTs. The second subdomain, hydrophobic, which binds the substrate counterpart (H site), can vary from one GST to another, resulting in structures able to recognize different substrates. In the present work, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent of human GSTA1 in its APO form, bound to GSH ligand and bound to GS-conjugated ligand. From MD, two probes were analyzed to (i) decipher the local conformational changes induced by the presence of the ligand and (ii) map the communication pathways involved in the ligand-binding process. These two local probes are, first, coarse-grained angles (theta,gamma), representing the local conformation of the protein main chain and, second, dihedral angles chi representing the local conformation of the amino-acid side chains. From the local probes time series, effective free-energy landscapes along the amino-acid sequence were analyzed and compared between the three different forms of GSTA1. This methodology allowed us to extract a network of 33 key residues, some of them being located in the experimentally well-known binding sites G and H of GSTA1 and others being located as far as 30 angstrom from the original binding sites. Finally, the collective motions associated with the network of key residues were established, showing a strong dynamical coupling between residues Gly14-Arg15 and Gln54-Val55, both in the same binding site (intrasite) but also between binding sites of each monomer (intersites).","[Nicolai, Adrien; Petiot, Nicolas; Grassein, Paul; Delarue, Patrice; Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, UMR CNRS 6303, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Neiers, Fabrice] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Ctr Sci Gout & Alimentat CSGA, CNRS, INRA, F-21000 Dijon, France",,"Nicolai, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, UMR CNRS 6303, F-21078 Dijon, France.",adrien.nicolai@u-bourgogne.fr,"NICOLAÏ, Adrien/P-9026-2019",,EIPHI Graduate School [ANR-17-EUR-0002]; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte,EIPHI Graduate School; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte),This work is supported by the EIPHI Graduate School (contrat ANR-17-EUR-0002) and the Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte.,,57,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Observations: Twelve patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis were treated with minocycline, 200 mg/d, for a median duration of 12 months. Three patients had extracutaneous lesions at the time of the study. The median follow-up was 26 months. A clinical response was observed in 10 patients, consisting of complete responses in 8 patients and partial responses in 2 patients. A progression of skin lesions was observed in 1 patient, and lesions remained stable in another patient. Adverse effects were minimal, except in 1 patient, who developed hypersensitivity syndrome. A slight hyperpigmentation occurred in 2 patients at the site of previous lesions, which completely disappeared after minocycline use was discontinued. A relapse of skin symptoms occurred after minocycline withdrawal in 3 patients, who further received doxycycline, 200 mg/d, allowing a complete remission of lesions. Conclusions: These results support that minocycline and doxycycline may be beneficial for the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis. Randomized controlled studies are warranted for the evaluation of the true efficacy of tetracyclines in these patients.","Hop St Louis, Inst Rech Peau, F-75475 Paris 10, France; Hop St Louis, Serv Dermatol 1, F-75475 Paris, France; Hop Tenon, Serv Pneumol, F-75970 Paris, France",,"Bachelez, H (通讯作者)，Hop St Louis, Inst Rech Peau, 1 Ave Claude Vellefaux, F-75475 Paris 10, France.",,,"bachelez, herve/0000-0003-3567-9095",,,,,24,148,156,0,0,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"515 N STATE ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA",0003-987X,,,ARCH DERMATOL,Arch.

To improve the serological diagnosis of systemic candidiasis, we used two different purified antigens of Candida albicans to study the IgG humoral response by ELISA (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay). Materials and methods. The antigen 48 is a cytoplasmic antigen with an enolase activity and was purified by ion exchange chromatography. The antigen 3D9 is a mannoprotein C. albicans germ-tube specific antigen, purified by gel filtration and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Sera were obtained from patients with systemic candidosis (n = 37), vaginal candidosis (n = 14), aspergillosis (n = 11) and from blood donors (n = 18). Results. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between absorbance values obtained with sera of the population of patients with systemic candidiasis and with sera of the three other populations (p < 0.0001). On the contrary, there was no significant difference (p > 0.3) between absorbance values obtained in populations of patients with vaginal candidosis, aspergillosis and blood donors. We obtained sensitivity and specificity values of 73 and 95,5 % respectively with IgG anti-Ag48 and of 78 and 82 % respectively with Ige anti-Ag3D9, Positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 90 and 80 % respectively with IgG anti-Ag48 and they were 84 and 84 % respectively with IgG anti-Ag3D9. Conclusion. Diagnostic parameters (specificity, sensitivity) were satisfactory and showed the usefulness of these antigens to determine IgG anti-Ag3D9 and IgG anti-Ag48 for the diagnosis of systemic candidosis.","FAC PHARM ANGERS,IMMUNOL PARASITOL LAB,F-49100 ANGERS,FRANCE",,,,,,,,,,0,2,2,0,0,MASSON EDITEUR,PARIS 06,"120 BLVD SAINT-GERMAIN, 75280 PARIS 06, FRANCE",1156-5233,,,J MYCOL MED,J.

Aggressive epidermotropic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (AECL) is a rare and aggressive form of lymphoma that exhibits systemic spread within a few months that is not preceded by any indolent form. Herein, we report a case of AECL occurring on foot lesions present for six years, and initially diagnosed as Woringer-Kolopp disease, or pagetoid cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Patients and methods. A male patient presented an ulcerated lesion of the ankle that had been present for six years. Biopsy revealed pagetoid migration of CD8+, CD2-, CD5-, CD7+, CD30- and CD56- lymphocytes with expression of cytotoxic markers and of Ki67 in over 60% of cells. The resulting diagnosis was one of pagetoid cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, also known as Woringer-Kolopp disease. Despite treatment with methotrexate and carmustine, the ulcer worsened rapidly within two months. Subsequent biopsy revealed epidermal and dermal infiltration with large cells of identical phenotype to that seen in the previous biopsy, with angiocentrism and expression of Ki67 in over 90% of cells, pointing to a diagnosis of AECL. Progression to disseminated ulceronecrotic lesions occurred rapidly, and the patient died of sepsis within a few months. Discussion. AECL is characterised by ulcerative-haemorrhagic lesions that develop aggressively without any preceding mild cutaneous lesions. Median survival is 12 months. Histological analysis shows pagetoid epidermotropism comprising large monomorphic CD8+, CD2- and CD5- cells with markers for cytotoxicity and high expression of Ki67. The initial indolent phase in the case we report herein accounts for the diagnostic confusion at the outset with Woringer-Kolopp disease. Negative status of CD2 and CD5 labels may allow prompt diagnosis of AECL. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Vice versa the hydrodynamic regime is influenced by the actual bathymetry. Spatio-temporal changes in the bathymetry can be detected by the analysis of continually acquired radar image sequences showing the roughness of the sea surface. The analysis of the image sequences is performed using a wavelet edge detection algorithm. Ship campaigns for coastal bathymery monitoring, e.g. with multibeam echo sounders are time consuming and expensive. Therefore a strategy is proposed to use the a priori information on the spatio-temporal bathymetry variations retrieved from the radar image sequences as a warning indicator. This indicator can be utilized to optimize the performance of high-accuracy ship measurement campaigns, focusing on the detection and observation of those regions which show high morphodynamical activity. The presented concept is of interest in order to monitor habour entrances, estuaries, or endangered coastal sectors.","GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Hydrophys, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany",,"Wolff, U (通讯作者)，GKSS Forschungszentrum Geesthacht GmbH, Inst Hydrophys, Max Planck Str, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,0-7803-6359-0,INT GEOSCI REMOTE SE,,,2000.0,,,,,,,2420,2422,,,,,,3,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography; Remote Sensing",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Physical Geography; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography; Remote Sensing,BT13Y,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000172046000787,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of protein deficiency in outpatients presenting with leg ulcers and the parameter's prognostic value for wound outcome. Design of study: Prospective controlled observational study. Setting: Ambulatory patients referred for chronic wounds to four university hospitals. Methods: Consecutive out-patients with a leg ulcer present for at least 2 months, related to venous insufficiency, associated or not with moderate peripheral arterial disease (ankle-brachial pressure index > 0.7), were included in a prospective study. Wound evaluation (area and occurrence of complications) was performed at baseline and at 12 weeks of follow-up. Biologic nutrition assessment (serum albumin, transthyretin, c-reactive protein) was performed at baseline. The control group consisted of consecutive patients free of leg ulceration and attending the dermatology outpatient clinic for remissive skin cancer or miscellaneous skin disorders. Results: Forty one patients and 43 controls were included. Serum albumin level was under 35 g/L (normal values: 36-44 g/L) in 27% of the patients and 2% of the controls (P < .001). At 12 weeks, 34% of the patients had an increase in wound area. Wound infections occurred in 12% (n = 5) of the patients. Protein deficiency was independently associated with an increase in wound area at 12 weeks (P = .034) and the presence of all inflammatory syndrome was associated with the occurrence of wound complications (wound infection or hospitalization) during follow-up (P < .001). Conclusion: The prevalence of protein deficiency in out-patients with leg ulcers is high and significantly associated with a poor healing prognosis.","[Meaume, Sylvie; Senet, Patricia] Hop Charles Foix, Serv Gerontol V, APHP, F-94205 Ivry, France; [Legendre, Cecile; Debure, Clelia] Hop Broussais, APHP, Serv Reeduc Vasc, F-75674 Paris, France; [Lok, Catherine] Hop Sud, Serv Dermatol, Amiens, France; [Senet, Patricia] Hop Rothschild, APHP, F-75571 Paris, France; [Golmard, Jean Louis] Univ Paris 06, Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Unite Biostat, APHP, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Golmard, Jean Louis] Univ Paris 06, EA 3974, F-75252 Paris 05, France",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Hop Charles Foix, Serv Gerontol V, APHP, 7 Ave Republ, F-94205 Ivry, France.",patricia.senet@cfx.aphp.fr,,,,,,,24,50,51,1,6,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0741-5214,,,J VASC SURG,J.

Paradoxical adipose hypertrophy (PAH) is a rare complication of cryolipolysis with important aesthetic consequences. Objectives: The objective of this study was to describe four cases of PAH after a cryolipolysis treatment. Methods: Between January 2014 and January 2017, all patients who had undergone a cryolipolysis treatment in a single center were reviewed. The device used was a CoolSculpting device and the same operator performed all the cryolipolysis treatments. We retrospectively included all patients who had a suspicion of PAH. Results: In our study, 398 patients underwent a session of cryolipolysis. Four patients presented with a voluminous painless swelling in the treated area, between 2 and 4 months after the cryolipolysis session. One patient was treated with liposuction. Histological analysis of the adipose tissue in this patient revealed a nonspecific panniculitis. The other three patients did not receive any additional treatment, and their symptoms stabilized after several months. Conclusions: Although cryolipolysis generally yields good results, it can be complicated with PAH, which tends to occur a few months after the cryolipolysis treatment. Patients should be informed of the possibility of developing this complication and encouraged to attend regular follow up for at least 6 months, so that this condition can be readily detected. Surgical treatment should be offered if there is no spontaneous improvement of the symptoms.","[Stroumza, Nathaniel; Barthelemy, Raphael Nail] Hop Tenon, Plast Surg, Paris, France; [Atlan, Michael] Hop Tenon, Plast & Aesthet Surg Dept, Plast Surg, Paris, France; [Senet, Patricia] Hop Tenon, Dept Dermatol, Dermatol, Paris, France; [Moguelet, Philippe] Hop Tenon, Anatomopathol Lab, Anatomopathol, Paris, France",,"Stroumza, N (通讯作者)，Hop Tenon, Dept Plast Reconstruct Aesthet Microsurg, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France.",nstroumza@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,15,17,2,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1090-820X,1527-330X,,AESTHET SURG J,Aesthet.

Adhesion of platelets to the column was dependent on both the germ tube concentration and the number of platelets applied, It was found that the interaction of C. albicans germ tubes with platelets is specific and should be mediated by a fungal protein receptor. The results obtained by scanning electron microscopy confirmed that resting platelets can fix directly onto germ tubes, In addition, this study showed that attachment of platelets onto C. albicans is associated with morphological changes. Platelets lost their discoid shape, became globular, generated spikes or pseudopods, and then flattened on the yeast cells.","UFR SCI MED & PHARMACEUT, LAB IMMUNOL MYCOL BACTERIOL, PHARM SECT, ANGERS, FRANCE; UFR SCI MED, LAB PARASITOL MYCOL, NANTES, FRANCE; UNIV BASQUE COUNTRY, FAC MED & ODONTOL, DEPT MICROBIOL IMMUNOL & PARASITOL, E-48080 BILBAO, SPAIN",,,,,,,,,,31,19,19,0,0,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0019-9567,1098-5522,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

Participants: A steering committee selected a panel of 27 experts with no declared conflicts of interest from lists of nursing staffs and physicians (specialists or general practitioners) with long-standing experience of wound care. The lists were put for-ward by 15 French learned societies. Evidence: The panelists received a recent systematic review of the literature, a classification of indications established by a working group, and definitions for the dressings. Consensus Process: The steering committee designed questionnaires on chronic wounds and on acute wounds including burns for each of the 2 panels. The consensus method was derived from the nominal group technique adapted by RAND/UCLA. Panelists rated the relevance of each possible dressing-indication combination on the basis of the published evidence and their own experience. After the first round of rating, they met to discuss results and propose recommendations before taking part in a second round of rating. The working group peer reviewed the final recommendations. Conclusions: A strong consensus was reached for use of the following combinations: for chronic wounds, (1) debridement stage, hydrogels; (2) granulation stage, foam and low-adherence dressings; and (3) epithelialization stage, hydrocolloid and low-adherence dressings; and for the epithelialization stage of acute wounds, low-adherence dressings.

The Finite Field Self Consistent Field method and scaling laws are used to evaluate the electronic contribution whereas the vibrational contribution is determined by using the harmonic oscillator approximation and an empirical force constant model. With the 3-21G split-valence atomic basis set, the computed electronic and vibrational contributions are 574.7 and 8.2 atomic units, respectively. The effect of the bond length alternation on the electronic polarizability is shown to be very weak. Noticing that the polarizability of buckminsterfullerene is close to that of ten benzene molecules, the buckminsterfullerene molecule can be seen as an entity formed by aromatic hexagons placed side by side where the electron delocalization all over the system is weak. The vibrational contribution to the static polarizability is found in good agreement with experimental measurements deduced from high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy spectra whereas infrared spectra provide much smaller values.","FAC UNIV NOTRE DAME PAIX,PHYS SOLIDE LAB,B-5000 NAMUR,BELGIUM; BELGIAN NATL FUND SCI RES,LOUVAIN,BELGIUM",,"PERPETE, EA (通讯作者)，FAC UNIV NOTRE DAME PAIX,CHIM THEOR APPL LAB,61 RUE BRUXELLES,B-5000 NAMUR,BELGIUM.",,,"CHAMPAGNE, Benoit/0000-0003-3678-8875",,,,,70,1,1,0,2,SOC CHIMIQUE BELGIQUE,BRUSSELS,"OFFICE INT DE LIBRAIRIE 30 AVE MARNIX, B-1050 BRUSSELS, BELGIUM",0037-9646,,,B SOC CHIM BELG,Bull.

Controlled fabrication and tunability of nanoporous membranes require a better understanding of their ionic conductivity capabilities at the nanoscale. Here, we developed a model of ionic conductivity for a KCl electrolyte through sub 5-nm single-layer MoS2 nanopores using equilibrium all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We investigate the dynamics of K+ and Cl- ions inside the pores in terms of concentration and mobility. We report that, for pore dimensions below 2.0 nm, which are of particular interest for biomolecule translocation applications, the behaviors of the concentration and mobility of ions strongly deviate from bulk properties. Specifically, we show that the freeenergy difference for insertion of an ion within the pore is proportional to the inverse surface area of the pore and that the inverse mobility scales linearly as the inverse diameter. Finally, we provide an improved analytical model taking into account the deviation of ion dynamics from bulk properties, suitable for direct comparison with experiments. (C) 2019 Author(s).

In the absence of mAbs, adhesion of C. albicans to polystyrene increased in parallel with germ-tube formation. However, the growth of the strains in the yeast phase at 25 degrees C or the use of an agerminative mutant inhibited adhesion to polystyrene. Serotype A and B strains showed similar kinetics of adhesion to polystyrene and no statistically significant differences in germination or adhesion were observed when strains from the two serotypes were compared. The three mAbs had different effects on both germination and adhesion of C. albicans. mAb 3D9 showed no influence on either germination or adhesion to polystyrene in two C. albicans strains, mAb B9E decreased both adhesion (45.6%) and filamentation (52.6%), and mAb 21E6 decreased filamentation (34.0%) but enhanced adhesion by 23.3%. This enhancement was also observed with the agerminative mutant and it was dose-dependent. It was not related to the binding capacity of the MAb to polystyrene nor to an increase in cell surface hydrophobicity of the antibody-treated cells, In conclusion, both growth phases of C. albicans can adhere to polystyrene, although the conditions for this process seem to be different in each phase. The two types of adhesion of C. albicans to polystyrene might have a role in the colonization of medical implants. The disparate effects shown by mAbs directed against cell wall mannoproteins of C. albicans on the adhesion of the fungus to polystyrene should be taken into consideration when designing strategies to block the adhesion of C. albicans to plastic materials with mAbs.","UNIV BASQUE COUNTRY, FAC MED & ODONTOL, DEPT INMUNOL MICROBIOL & PARASITOL, E-48080 BILBAO, VIZCAYA, SPAIN; UER SCI MED & PHARMACEUT, PHARM SECT, LAB IMMUNOL PARASITOL, F-49100 ANGERS, FRANCE",,,,"Quindós, Guillermo/I-2577-2015; SAN MILLAN GUTIERREZ, ROSARIO MARIA/F-9966-2016","Quindós, Guillermo/0000-0003-0438-2248; SAN MILLAN GUTIERREZ, ROSARIO MARIA/0000-0003-2222-9474; Ezkurra Garcia-Unzueta, Pilar Ariadna/0000-0002-3899-1992",,,,,26,27,27,0,1,MICROBIOLOGY SOC,LONDON,"14-16 MEREDITH ST, LONDON, ENGLAND",1350-0872,1465-2080,,MICROBIOL-SGM,Microbiology-(UK),AUG,1996.0,142,,8,,,,2271,2277,,,,,,7,Microbiology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Microbiology,VB829,8760939.0,Bronze,,,2022-10-10,WOS:A1996VB82900043,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the other hand, using the linear response theory, the Hirshfeld partitioning of the electronic density, and an electrostatic model for the local electric field, we define a screened molecular polarisability for a molecule in a cluster. One shows that this local polarisability varies with the size of the cluster, the location of the molecule, and the hydrogen bond network.

This work assesses the possibility to measure FSBP on the 2nd phalanx instead of the first one in order to improve its sensitivity and to verify this would not alter the repeatability of the measurement. Methods: In this multicenter study, FSBP was measured twice in all fingers but the thumbs in consecutive systemic sclerosis patients on the first phalanx and the second phalanx in alternate order using laser-Doppler flowmetry. Results: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled. The repeatability of FSBP was excellent and similar on the first and 2nd phalanxes with coefficients of variation respectively of 7.1% and 7.6%. While the correlation between the FSBP at the two sites was fair (Pearson coefficient 0.69; p < 0.001). The agreement was poor, with a mean difference of 14 mm Hg between the two sites. Significantly higher differences were found in fingers with digital ulcers. The ROC curves showed a better prediction of the 2nd phalanx measurements. Conclusion: FSBP has an excellent repeatability whatever the site of phalanx. However, measurements performed on the 2nd phalanx have a better sensitivity for the prediction of digital ulcers.","[Blaise, Sophie; Pellegrini, Laure; Carpentier, Patrick] Grenoble Alpes Univ Hosp, Dept Vasc Med, CS 10217, F-38000 Grenoble 09, France; [Blaise, Sophie; Cracowski, Jean-Luc] Univ Grenoble Alpes, HP2, INSERM, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Constans, Joel] Hop St Andre, Serv Med Vasc, 1 Rue Jean Burguet, F-33075 Bordeaux, France; [Senet, Patricia] Hop Tenon, Serv Dermatol Med Vasc & Allergol, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France; [Lazareth, Isabelle] Hop St Joseph, Serv Med Vasc, 185 Rue Raymond Losserand, F-75014 Paris, France; [Cracowski, Jean-Luc] Grenoble Alpes Univ Hosp, INSERM CIC1406, F-38000 Grenoble, France",,"Blaise, S (通讯作者)，Grenoble Alpes Univ Hosp, Dept Vasc Med, CS 10217, F-38000 Grenoble 09, France.",SBlaise@chu-grenoble.fr,,,Societe Francaise de Medecine Vasculaire; Societe Francaise de Microcirculation,Societe Francaise de Medecine Vasculaire; Societe Francaise de Microcirculation,"This study was supported by the Societe Francaise de Medecine Vasculaire, and the Societe Francaise de Microcirculation.",,29,4,4,0,2,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0026-2862,1095-9319,,MICROVASC RES,Microvasc.

The global polarizabilities of the water isomers were found to depend mainly on the total number of water molecules rather than their cluster structures. We show that this result hides in fact a strong heterogeneity of the molecular polarizability within the different isomers. The global polarizability of a cluster was divided into a sum of molecular contributions by using the Hirshfeld partitioning scheme. We reveal that the value of the local polarizability of a molecule in the cluster is correlated with the number and type of the hydrogen bonds (HB) the molecule forms. Consequently, the molecules located in the interior of the cluster, which usually form more HBs, have smaller molecular polarizabilities than the molecules at the surface, which form less HBs. The contribution of intermolecular interaction to the global polarizability was analyzed by decomposing the cluster polarizability into intra- and inter-molecular contributions. The former measures the polarization within the molecular basin against the external electric field, while the latter is described as the sum of polarizability caused by charge flow through the HBs. These two contributions vary with the cluster size: the intermolecular contribution decreases with the cluster size on the contrary of the intramolecular contribution which increases.","[Yang, Fang; Wang, Xin; Yang, Mingli] Sichuan Univ, Inst Nanobiomed Technol & Membrane Biol, West China Hosp, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Krishtal, Alisa; van Alsenoy, Christian] Univ Antwerp, Struct Chem Grp, Dept Chem, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Delarue, Patrice; Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne, Inst Carnot Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 5209, F-21078 Dijon, France",,"Yang, ML (通讯作者)，Sichuan Univ, Inst Nanobiomed Technol & Membrane Biol, West China Hosp, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.",myang@scu.edu.cn; patrick.senet@u-bourgogne.fr,"Yang, Mingli/E-9983-2012","Yang, Mingli/0000-0001-8590-8840",Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [20873088]; SRFDP [20070610175]; SRF for ROCS [20091341-11-10]; Major State Basic Research Development Program of China [2005CB623901]; Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders (FWO) [G.0629.06],Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); SRFDP(Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP)); SRF for ROCS(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); Major State Basic Research Development Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"F.

We show how the crystal structure of several-thousands-anstroms-thick samarium films can be tailored by the elaboration conditions (i.e. the deposition of a thin Nd template layer): either a nine hexagonal close-packed plane stacking sequence (Sm-structure), as bulk samarium, or a four hexagonal close-packed plane (dhcp) structure are obtained. Moreover, this unusual dhcp structure for pure samarium has also been stabilized in nanoscale (0 0 1) Sm/Nd superlattices that thus present a coherent dhcp stacking over several bilayers. Both dhcp Sm films and coherent dhcp Sm/Nd superlattices are of broad interest for investigations of the link between structure and magnetism in rare earth epitaxied systems.

This can be explained in terms of the observed delocalisation of the C-60 electrons towards the surface resulting in an additional attraction (repulsion) of the molecule to the Ge cations (S anions) beyond the purely van der Waals interaction, which also accounts for the observed increased molecule-substrate bonding relative to the intermolecular bonding.","FAC UNIV NOTRE DAME PAIX,B-5000 NAMUR,BELGIUM; MAX PLANCK INST STROMUNGSFORSCH,D-37073 GOTTINGEN,GERMANY",,,,,"Henrard, Luc/0000-0002-2564-1221; Lambin, Philippe/0000-0001-8051-042X",,,,,20,23,23,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0039-6028,,,SURF SCI,Surf.

Both MAbs reacted strongly with cells with Mi > 3.0, i.e., with pseudohyphal and hyphal forms, but in Eagle's medium at 26-degrees-C and in a modified Sabouraud's broth medium at 30-degrees-C, some reactivity was also found with cells of lower Mi (i.e., yeast forms). Therefore, it was concluded that the hyphal phenotype and the epitopes reactive with the MAbs were co-expressed but that the epitopes could also be expressed independently of the hyphal phenotype. The results confirm the propensity of C. albicans for variation of its surface antigenic composition.","UNIV LEICESTER,DEPT MICROBIOL,LEICESTER LE1 7RH,ENGLAND; UNIV LEEDS,DEPT MICROBIOL,LEEDS LS2 9JT,W YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND; UNIV ANGERS,IMMUNOL LAB,ANGERS,FRANCE; JANSSEN RES FDN,DEPT BACTERIOL & MYCOL,B-2340 BEERSE,BELGIUM",,,,,,,,,,20,8,8,0,0,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,LONDON,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",0022-2615,,,J MED MICROBIOL,J.

With a coherent system the surface current can be detected by the Doppler frequency shift of the backscattered signal. In comparision to a full coherent radar the advantage is clearly the very low price.

Surface graft polymerization was demonstrated by FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Determination of azlactone loading of the PP-g-VDM films and fabrics was achieved by titration. It was confirmed that grafted poly(VDM) chains are reactive towards nucleophiles such as water, benzylamine, Jeffamine M600((R)), and poly-benzyl (beta-benzyl aspartate) omega-benzylamide used as a model of peptidic chain. Sericin, a natural water-soluble protein issued from silk degumming, was immobilized onto PP-g-VDM fabrics. Mass uptake up to 10% was obtained at room temperature using the raw solution resulting from industrial degumming process. Immobilization of sericin onto PP-g-NDM fabrics was assessed by FTIR, XPS, and determination of amino acid content after acidic hydrolysis. The results suggest that this technique is useful for obtaining permanent altered surfaces and that PP-g-VDM films and fabrics could be used for deproteinization of aqueous solutions as well as in the field of combinatorial chemistry as scavengers or substrates.","Univ Maine, UMR CNRS 6011, UCO2M, LCOM Chim Phys, F-72089 Le Mans 9, France; ISOCHEM, Grp SNPE, F-91710 Vert Le Petit, France; Inst Francais Text & Habillement, F-69134 Ecully, France",,"Fontaine, L (通讯作者)，Univ Maine, UMR CNRS 6011, UCO2M, LCOM Chim Phys, Ave O Messiaen, F-72089 Le Mans 9, France.",,"Fontaine, Laurent/K-5190-2016","Fontaine, Laurent/0000-0003-0043-1508",,,,,26,31,31,1,36,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"PO BOX 10 11 61, D-69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1022-1352,,,MACROMOL CHEM PHYSIC,Macromol.

Each Al atom adds a net negative charge to the otherwise SiO2 lattice which is counterbalanced by an extra-framework mobile cation. These counter-ions are responsible for the major polarization of the material at low frequencies (10(6) Hz). The nature, localization and diffusion of these cations depend on the Si/Al ratio and influence the catalytic properties of the material. Here, we present a joint theory-experiment study of these properties at the atomic level. The thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) of Na-mordenites is measured for increasing Si/Al ratios. The analysis of these dielectric relaxation data leads to activation energy barriers for the Na+ jumps responsible for the polarization change. Using semi-empirical inter-atomic potentials and Monte Carlo algorithms we propose a possible mechanism for the cation motions occurring in TSDC experiments. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In order to study the antigenic relationship between blastoconidia and germ tubes of C. albicans, we produced several monoclonal antibodies and analyzed their reactivity against cell wall antigens either in intact cells or in cells treated with dithiothreitol. Overall, four types of reactivity were found. Monoclonal antibodies 3D9 and 15C9 stained the germ tubes only when tested by indirect immunofluorescence. However, they showed a different reactivity by immunoblotting. Monoclonal antibody 3D9 reacted with antigens with molecular masses of > 200 and 180 kDa specifically expressed in the germ tube. Monoclonal antibody 15C9 reacted with antigens of 87, 50, and 34 kDa present in the germ tube extract and with antigens of 92, 50, 34, and 32 kDa present in the blastoconidium extract. The reactivity of blastoconidia treated for different times with dithiothreitol with these monoclonal antibodies was also studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The reactivity of monoclonal antibody 3D9 did not significantly change during the cell wall extraction. However, the reactivity of monoclonal antibody 15C9 was increased for blastoconidia extracted for 60 min and decreased markedly for blastoconidia extracted for 120 min. Monoclonal antibody G3B was nonreactive by indirect immunofluorescence but reacted with antigens of 47 and 38 kDa present in the germ tube extract and with an antigen of 47 kDa present in the blastoconidium extract. Monoclonal antibody B9E stained both morphological phases by indirect immunofluorescence. By immunoblotting, it reacted with antigens of > 70 kDa present in the germ tube extract and with antigens of > 63, 56, 47, and 38 kDa present in the blastoconidium extract. Based on the results presented in this study, four types of antigens are described. Type I antigens are expressed on the outermost layers of the germ tube cell wall only. Type II antigens are expressed both on the germ tube cell wall surface and within the blastoconidium cell wall. Type III antigens are found within the cell wall of both blastoconidia and germ tubes. Type IV antigens are expressed on both the blastoconidium and germ tube surface. Two types more can be hypothesized for antigens expressed on the blastoconidium cell surface and within the germ tube cell wall (type V) and for those expressed on the blastoconidium surface only (type VI).","UFR SCI MED & PHARMACEUT, PHARM SECT, IMMUNOL PARASITOL LAB, F-49100 ANGERS, FRANCE",,"PONTON, J (通讯作者)，UNIV BASQUE COUNTRY, FAC MED & ODONTOL, DEPT IMMUNOL MICROBIOL & PARASITOL, APARTADO 699, E-48080 BILBAO, SPAIN.",,,"Ezkurra Garcia-Unzueta, Pilar Ariadna/0000-0002-3899-1992",,,,,32,44,46,0,1,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0019-9567,,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, clinical features and visceral involvements of 25 SSc cases with normal/nonspecific NVC were compared to 63 SSc controls with the SSc-specific NVC pattern. Results: Normal/nonspecific NVC versus SSc-specific NVC pattern was significantly associated with absence of skin sclerosis (32 vs. 6.3%, p = 0.004), absence of telangiectasia (47.8 vs. 17.3%, p = 0.006) and absence of sclerodactyly (60 vs. 25.4%, p = 0.002), and less frequent severe pulmonary involvement (26.3 vs. 58.2%, p = 0.017).

First, a poly(4,4-dimethyl-2-vinyl-5-oxazolone) (PVDM) and four P(VDM-co-MMA)s were prepared by free-radical polymerization. Chemical transformation reactions were then performed on these polymer backbones with 4-cyano-4'-(beta-aminoethoxy)biphenyl. This amine was synthesized according to a novel procedure. The functionalized polymers are isotropic and show glass transition temperatures up to 132 degrees C. They can easily be processed by spin-coating into thin films of optical quality. These films were oriented by a corona discharge process, and ultraviolet spectroscopic measurements were performed to study the axial ordering kinetics as a function of poling conditions. Second-order nonlinear optical coefficients (d(33) and d(31)) were measured at a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm. The ratio d(33)/d(31) Was found to be close to 3, as expected for amorphous isotropic polymers. No significant relaxation was observed at ambient conditions in 2 months. Hydrogen bonding between GO-NH groups of neighboring side chains are felt to contribute to the stability of the second-order nonlinear optical properties in these PVDM systems.","ESPCI, URA 278, LAB PHYSICOCHIM STRUCT & MACROMOL, F-75231 PARIS 05, FRANCE; UNIV MAINE, URA 509, LAB CHIM & PHYSICOCHIM MACROMOL, F-72017 LE MANS, FRANCE; SOC NATL POUDRES & EXPLOS, CTR RECH BOUCHET, F-91710 VERT LE PETIT, FRANCE; CENS, LETI DEIN SPE, CEA DTA, LAB PHYS ELECT MAT, F-91191 GIF SUR YVETTE, FRANCE",,,,"Chevalier, Sebastien/AAI-3481-2020",,,,,,44,4,4,0,4,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1022-1352,1521-3935,,MACROMOL CHEM PHYS,Macromol.

Hsp70s, which consist of a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD, consisting of NBD-I and NBD-II subdomains) and a substrate-binding domain [SBD, further split into the beta-sheet (SBD-beta) and alpha-helical (SBD-alpha) subdomains], occur in two major conformations having (a) a closed SBD, in which the SBD and NBD domains do not interact, and (b) an open SBD, in which SBD-alpha interacts with NBD-I and SBD-beta interacts with the top parts of NBD-I and NBD-II. In the SBD-closed conformation, SBD is bound to a substrate protein, with release occurring after transition to the open conformation. While the transition from the closed to the open conformation is triggered efficiently by binding of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the NBD, it also occurs, although less frequently, in the absence of ATP. The reverse transition occurs after ATP hydrolysis. Here, we report canonical and multiplexed replica exchange simulations of the conformational dynamics of Hsp70s using a coarse-grained molecular dynamics approach with the UNRES force field. The simulations were run in the following three modes: (i) with the two halves of the NBD unrestrained relative to each other, (ii) with the two halves of the NBD restrained in an open geometry as in the SBD-closed form of DnaK (2KHO), and (iii) with the two halves of NBD restrained in a closed geometry as in known experimental structures of ATP-bound NBD forms of Hsp70. Open conformations, in which the SBD interacted strongly with the NBD, formed spontaneously during all simulations; the number of transitions was largest in simulations carried out with the closed NBD domain, and smallest in those carried out with the open NBD domain; this observation is in agreement with the experimentally observed influence of ATP-binding on the transition of Hsp70s from the SBD-closed to the SBD-open form. Two kinds of open conformations were observed: one in which SBD-alpha interacts with NBD-I and SBD-beta interacts with the top parts of NBD-I and NBD-II (as observed in the structures of nucleotide exchange factors), and another one in which this interaction pattern is swapped. A third type of motion, in which SBD-alpha binds to NBD without dissociating from SBD-beta, was also observed. It was found that the first stage of interdomain communication (approach of SBD-beta, to NBD) is coupled with the rotation of the long axes of NBD-I and NBD-II toward each other. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful simulation of the full transition of an Hsp70 from the SBD-closed to the SBD-open conformation.","[Golas, Ewa; Czaplewski, Cezary; Liwo, Adam] Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, PL-80952 Gdansk, Poland; [Golas, Ewa; Maisuradze, Gia G.; Senet, Patrick; Oldziej, Stanislaw; Czaplewski, Cezary; Scheraga, Harold A.] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne ICB, Unite Mixte Rech 6303, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Oldziej, Stanislaw] Univ Gdansk, Lab Biopolymer Struct, Intercollegiate Fac Biotechnol, Med Univ Gdansk, PL-80822 Gdansk, Poland",,"Liwo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, Sobieskiego 18, PL-80952 Gdansk, Poland.",adam@chem.univ.gda.pl,"Ołdziej, Stanisław/L-6113-2014; Czaplewski, Cezary/E-1503-2016","Czaplewski, Cezary/0000-0002-0294-3403; Liwo, Adam/0000-0001-6942-2226; Oldziej, Stanislaw/0000-0002-4583-3941","Foundation for Polish Science [MPD/2010/5]; National Institutes of Health [GM-14312]; National Science Foundation [MCB10-19767]; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [N N204 049035]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; John von Neumann Institute for Computing at the Central Institute for Applied Mathematics; Forschungszentrum Julich, Germany; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center; Informatics Center of the Metropolitan Academic Network (IC MAN) in Gdansk; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [R01GM014312] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Foundation for Polish Science(Foundation for Polish ScienceEuropean Commission); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland); Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); John von Neumann Institute for Computing at the Central Institute for Applied Mathematics; Forschungszentrum Julich, Germany; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center; Informatics Center of the Metropolitan Academic Network (IC MAN) in Gdansk; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS))","We thank Adrien Nicolai (Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire Carnot de Bourgogne, Universite de Bourgogne, Dijon) and Dr. Jaroslaw Marszalek (Intercollegiate Faculty of Biotechnology, University of Gdansk and Medical University of Gdansk, Poland) for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) has been shown to influence adhesion and virulence of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans. The aim of this work was to identify the potential cell surface (glyco)proteins supporting the relative CSH according to the morphological phase and culture conditions of Candida albicans. Material and methods. To characterize cell surface hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, Candida albicans Zymolyase crude soluble extracts of germ tubes and blastoconidia were fractionated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Prior to extraction, Candida cells were biotinylated in order to label cell surface proteins and glycoproteins. Proteinic and glycosylated compounds of the fractionated extracts were then tested by SDS-PAGE and concanavalin A staining, and probed with streptavidin peroxidase conjugate. Results and conclusion. For both morphological phases, cell surface hydrophilic fractions corresponded to highly glycosylated components of high molecular masses (over 94-kDa) and to a 34-kDa glycoprotein, whereas hydrophobic material was mainly represented by proteins with molecular masses between 10- to 94-kDa. Cell surface glycosylated high molecular mass components were more slightly hydrophobic for blastoconidia grown at 22 degreesC than for yeasts grown at 37 degreesC. Chromatography allowed identification of two peculiar cell surface germ tube specific components: a glycosylated polydispersed material of 110- to 220-kDa, and a 30-kDa proteinic components. These two hyphal phase specific components were characterized as being very hydrophobic.","Fac Pharm Angers, UFR Sci Pharmaceut & Ingn Sante, Lab Immunol Parasitol, F-49100 Angers, France",,"Marot-Leblond, A (通讯作者)，Fac Pharm Angers, UFR Sci Pharmaceut & Ingn Sante, Lab Immunol Parasitol, 16 Bd Daviers, F-49100 Angers, France.",agnes.marot@univ-angers.fr,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,1,MASSON EDITEUR,MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9,"21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE",1156-5233,1773-0449,,J MYCOL MED,J.

The mAb A6 A E4 is an IgG2b with kappa light chains and reacted only with Listeria antigens without any cross reaction with other organisms tested by ELISA, dot-blotting and Western-blotting. With the same conditions, the three other mAbs reacted with Listeria and with other genus extracts, particularly with Streptococcus and Enterococcus. mAb A6 A E4-reactive antigens are proteins, and glycoprotein immunoassay indicated that the epitope is devoid of carbohydrate moiety.

Although early detection can be lifesaving, prevention programmes are under-utilized. In 2008, a group of board-certified dermatologists in Switzerland established a website aimed at educating about skin cancer risk factors and providing guidance on self-assessment. Objectives To present the data of this programme over the last 10 years with regards to representation of the targeted groups and sustained impact on primary skin cancer prevention. Materials & Methods A comprehensive web-based health promotion campaign was established for education and guidance on self-assessment. Teledermatological evaluation was offered and participants were then interviewed. Results In total, 11,171 digital photos were evaluated during 2008-2018; 54.3% (n = 6,067) from females and 45.7% (n = 5,104) from males. In 26.7% (n = 2,983), clinical examination was recommended. Of the participants, 1,874 replied revealing 103 malignancies (9.2% of the lesions were presented to a physician): 34 melanomas in situ, six squamous cell carcinomas, 53 basal cell carcinomas and 10 malignant lesions (not further specified). Of the participants, 40.5% (n = 683) changed their attitude towards sun exposure, 48.7% (n = 820) used more sunscreen, and 57.5% (n = 966) improved sunscreen measures. Conclusion Web-based educational programmes raise public awareness, enhance prevention, and support early diagnosis of skin cancer. Teledermatology might contribute to reducing skin cancer mortality rates","[Meyer, Stephanie Rachael; Imhof, Laurence; Dummer, Reinhard; Barysch, Marjam J.] Univ Hosp Zurich, Dept Dermatol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rudzki-Senet, Agnes; Emde, Nastia-Lara] LOreal Act Cosmet, La Roche Posay, 10 Chemin Blandonnet, CH-1214 Vernier, Switzerland",,"Dummer, R (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Zurich, Dept Dermatol, Zurich, Switzerland.",reinhard.dummer@usz.ch; marjam@barysch.com,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,4,JOHN LIBBEY EUROTEXT LTD,ARCUEIL,"30, RUE BERTHOLLET, BATIMENT A, 94110 ARCUEIL, FRANCE",1167-1122,1952-4013,,EUR J DERMATOL,Eur.

We produced two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (12C9 and 18E2) by immunizing mice,vith a partially purified extract of P. halstedii race 1. Both MAbs detected in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) all races of P, halstadii present in France, No cross-reactions were observed with Plasmopara viticola or with other fungi commonly associated with sunflowers. Both MAbs recognized the same three fungal antigens with molecular masses of 68, 140, and 192 kDa. However, the epitopes on the fungal antigens were distinct and repetitive. Seed homogenates from infected plants were incubated in wells coated with MAb 18E2, This resulted in the trapping of P, halstedii antigens that were identified with biotinylated MAb 12C9. No reactions were seen with seed homogenates from healthy plants. Thus, our results suggest that these MAbs might be used to develop a sandwich ELISA detection system for P, halstedii in infected seeds.","Fac Pharm Angers, Lab Parasitol Mycol, Grp Etud Interact Hote Parasite, F-49100 Angers, France; Grp Etud Varietes & Semences, F-49071 Beaucouze, France",,"Robert, R (通讯作者)，Fac Pharm Angers, Lab Parasitol Mycol, Grp Etud Interact Hote Parasite, 16 Bd Daviers, F-49100 Angers, France.",,,,,,,,33,8,12,0,2,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0099-2240,,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

At the local scale, protein unfolding is, however, heterogeneous and probe dependent. Here, we consider local order parameters defined by the local curvature and torsion of the protein main chain. Because chemical shifts (CS's) measured by NMR spectroscopy are extremely sensitive to the local atomic environment, CS has served as a local probe of thermal unfolding of proteins by varying the position of the atomic isotope along the amino acid sequence. The variation of the CS of each C-alpha atom along the sequence as a function of the temperature defines a local heat-induced denaturation curve. We demonstrate that these local heat- induced denaturation curves mirror the local protein nativeness defined by the free energy landscape of the local curvature and torsion of the protein main chain described by the C-alpha-C-alpha virtual bonds. Comparison between molecular dynamics simulations and CS data of the gpW protein demonstrates that some local native states defined by the local curvature and torsion of the main chain, mainly located in secondary structures, are coupled to each other whereas others, mainly located in flexible protein segments, are not. Consequently, CS's of some residues are faithful reporters of global protein unfolding, with heat-induced denaturation curves similar to the average global one, whereas other residues remain silent about the protein unfolded state. For the latter, the local deformation of the protein main chain, characterized by its local curvature and torsion, is not cooperatively coupled to global unfolding.","[Scheraga, Harold A.; Maisuradze, Gia G.; Senet, Patrick] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Grassein, Paul; Delarue, Patrice; Nicolai, Adrien; Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Neiers, Fabrice] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, INRA, Ctr Sci Gout & Alimentat CSGA, Dijon, France",,"Maisuradze, GG; Senet, P (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Senet, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, F-21078 Dijon, France.",gm56@cornell.edu; psenet@u-bourgogne.fr,"Neiers, Fabrice/AAM-1637-2021; NICOLAÏ, Adrien/P-9026-2019","Neiers, Fabrice/0000-0002-8965-4929; NICOLAI, Adrien/0000-0001-7779-4652","National Institutes of Health [R01GM14312]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research; Directorate for Engineering of the National Science Foundation, Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Office [FA9550-17-1-0047]; Bourgogne Franche-Comte Graduate School EUREIPHI [17-EURE-0002]","National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); Directorate for Engineering of the National Science Foundation, Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Office; Bourgogne Franche-Comte Graduate School EUREIPHI","The calculations were performed by using HPC resources from DSI-CCuB (Centre de Calcul de l'Universite de Bourgogne).

However, the retrieval of significant wave height is difficult because the radar image spectrum (a backscatter intensity variance spectrum) has to be transferred to a wave spectrum (a surface elevation variance spectrum) using a modulation transfer function (MTF) which requires extensive calibration for each individual radar setup. In contrast to the backscatter intensity, the Doppler velocity measured by a coherent radar is induced by the radial velocity (or line-of-sight velocity) of the surface scattering and its periodic component is mainly the contribution of surface waves. Therefore, the variance of the Doppler velocity can be utilized to retrieve the significant wave height. Analyzing approximately 100 days of Doppler velocity measurements of a coherent-on-receive radar operating at X-band with vertical polarization in transmit and receive, a simple relation was derived and validated to retrieve significant wave heights. Comparison to wave measurements of a wave rider buoy as well as an acoustic wave and current profiler resulted in a root mean square error of 0.24m with a bias of 0.08 m. Furthermore, the different sources of error are discussed and investigated.","[Carrasco, Ruben; Stresser, Michael; Horstmann, Jochen] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Radar Hydrog, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany",,"Stresser, M (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Coastal Res, Dept Radar Hydrog, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.",michael.stresser@hzg.de,"Streßer, Michael/GRY-0570-2022; Carrasco, Ruben/R-9738-2017","Streßer, Michael/0000-0002-6214-8161; Carrasco, Ruben/0000-0003-0428-0698; Horstmann, Jochen/0000-0002-7979-5736",Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) [0327533C]; Coastal Observing System for Northern and Arctic Seas (COSYNA),Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)(Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)); Coastal Observing System for Northern and Arctic Seas (COSYNA),The authors would like to kindly thank Christian Senet of the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) for provision of the buoy and AWAC data at Fino-3.

Injection of such products can induce immediate hypersensitivity reactions, some of which are IgE-mediated, and delayed hypersensitivity reaction with all types of drug eruptions being reported. Allergy tests, whether patch-tests or intradermal tests, are useful to confirm whether patients are allergic. At the end of these tests, depending on the reaction (chronology and clinical symptoms) and the results of the skin tests, patients are given an allergy card as well as a detailed certificate indicating the various ICM contraindicated and those allowed. Observations. - We report herein three cases of patients experiencing a confirmed allergic eruption after injection of ICM, and whose recommendations and contraindication were not taken into consideration, leading to recurrence of eruption after renewed ICM injection. Discussion. - The three cases we report herein underscore the lack of knowledge concerning eruptions induced by ICM, particularly among radiologists. Better dissemination of information about the existence of such reactions appears necessary amongst the medical professionals concerned. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Patients and methods. - Herein we present the cases of two men aged 56 and 23 years presenting SSc without anti-Scl70 or anti-centronnere antibodies but with anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies. Clinical symptoms led us to prescribe more laboratory exams and both patients were diagnosed with cancer of the nasopharyngeal area. Discussion. - Anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies are useful for SSc diagnosis in patients without anti-centromere or anti-Scl70 antibodies. Their presence must lead physicians to screen for associated cancer, even in the absence of clinical signs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

For each Si/Al ratio, a combination of solid-state Si-29 NMR and Monte Carlo simulations is used and leads to the proposal of a realistic structural model where the aluminum atoms are distributed among the four possible crystallographic sites. Then, the positions of the cations stabilizing the mordenite lattice are obtained by using Monte Carlo simulated annealing. The populations of the sites occupied by the cations and their variations with the Si/Al ratio predicted by the model are in very good agreement with those measured by thermally stimulated current spectroscopy on Na-mordenites.","Univ Montpellier 2, LPMC, UMR 5617, CNRS, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France; Univ Antwerp, Dept Phys, CDROM2, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium",,"Henn, F (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier 2, LPMC, UMR 5617, CNRS, Pl E Bataillon,CC003, F-34095 Montpellier 05, France.",,"MAURIN, Guillaume GM/G-7435-2015; Devautour-vinot, Sabine/V-9727-2018","MAURIN, Guillaume GM/0000-0002-2096-0450; Devautour-vinot, Sabine/0000-0002-3812-7379",,,,,32,45,45,0,11,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1089-5647,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

Their onset during the course of pro-thermogenic and autoimmune diseases has been widely reported, but the association with predisposing locoregional causes is not well known. Patients and methods. - Case 1: a 57-year-old man, who smoked 80 packets per year, presenting a deficit of the levator muscles in his right foot following lumbar sciatica with paralysis of L5, consulted for unilateral necrotic lesions of the toes recurring each winter in the paralysed limb only. Case 2: a 60-year-old man had a previous history of liposarcoma of the right side treated with radiotherapy and surgery, resulting in sequelae of monoparesis and radiation-induced arteritis. Each winter, he presented recurring unilateral purpuric macules of the toes on his right foot, with no necrotic progression. In both cases, clinical examination, disease progression over time, histology and laboratory tests confirmed the diagnosis of idiopathic chilblains. Conclusion. - The physiopathological hypotheses posited to account for the unilateral appearance of chilblains in the event of paralysis include decreased blood flow to the paralysed limb, imbalance in neuromodulators, dysfunction of the autonomous nervous system, cutaneous atrophy with hypertrophy of underlying soft tissues, and finally, hypoesthesia aggravating the trophic disorders.

Tacrolimus remains the antirejection treatment (ART) of choice in kidney transplantation but tolerance with systemic terbinafine for the management of severe onychomycosis has not been studied. Objective This study illustrates severe onychomycosis management in a kidney transplantation setting and investigates systemic terbinafine tolerance profile in KTR. Patients/Methods We retrospective analysed clinical data of KTR with a confirmed diagnosis of severe onychomycosis. Results We retrieved a total of 29 KTR with severe onychomycosis needing an oral treatment to manage onychomycosis. In 55.1% (16/29) KTR, altered renal biological parameters or lack of guidelines to manage severe onychomycosis were the main reasons to deterring clinicians from prescribing oral treatments. 13 patients received an oral terbinafine treatment (9, 3 and 1 with a tacrolimus, cyclosporine and everolimus-based ART, respectively). Clinical and biological follow-up did not reveal severe drug interactions. ART blood levels showed significant variations in 2 patients without clinical consequences in renal graft. Two patients reported mild adverse events but after only one dose of terbinafine. Using an open-source image analysis program, clinical evolution of onychomycosis could be retrospectively quantified and followed up. Conclusions The results presented here suggest that oral terbinafine can be proposed to treat severe onychomycosis with an acceptable tolerance profile in KTR with different ART such as tacrolimus and highlight the need of multicentric studies to establish guidelines for onychomycosis treatment in KTR.","[Moreno-Sabater, Alicia; Chasset, Francois] Sorbonne Univ, Ctr Immunol & Malad Infect CIMI Paris, Inserm U1135, F-75013 Paris, France; [Moreno-Sabater, Alicia; Hennequin, Christophe] Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Serv Parasitol Mycol, Paris, France; [Ouali, Nacera] Hop Tenon, Serv Urgences Nephrol & Transplantat Renale, Paris, France; [Chasset, Francois; Frances, Camille; Senet, Patricia; Faucon, Caroline; Bachmeyer, Claude] Hop Tenon, AP HP, Serv Dermatol Allergol, Paris, France; [Hennequin, Christophe] Sorbonne Univ, AP HP, INSERM, Ctr Rech St Antoine, Paris, France",,"Moreno-Sabater, A (通讯作者)，Sorbonne Univ, Ctr Immunol & Malad Infect CIMI Paris, Inserm U1135, F-75013 Paris, France.",alicia.moreno-sabater@sorbonne-universite.fr,"Hennequin, Christophe/AAF-2755-2021; Moreno Sabater, Alicia/P-3536-2017","Hennequin, Christophe/0000-0002-4528-927X; Moreno Sabater, Alicia/0000-0002-7571-9533",,,,,26,1,1,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0933-7407,1439-0507,,MYCOSES,Mycoses,MAR,2021.0,64,3,,,,,309,315,,10.1111/myc.13220,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/myc.13220,,DEC 2020,7,Dermatology; Mycology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Dermatology; Mycology,QF5WA,33245794.0,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000595225800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The pertinence of performing a skin biopsy to diagnose HLU is questionable, as cutaneous arteriolosclerosis may be related to patient comorbidities. The objective here was to evaluate the frequency of arteriolosclerosis in skin leg biopsies performed in patients without ulcer and in control patients with HLU. Methods: We performed a retrospective study between January 2013 and July 2014. Patients were included if they had undergone a deep skin biopsy on the lower limbs, in the absence of any leg ulcer. Controls were patients with typical HLU. Results: Fifty-eight patients and 6 controls were included. Hypertension was present in 25 patients (43%). Arteriolosclerosis, defined as fibrous endarteritis, was present in 35 out of 58 patients (60%) and in all of the controls. No hyalinosis or hyperplastic proliferative arteriolosclerosis was observed in the patients or controls. Only age was an independent factor associated with the presence of cutaneous arteriolosclerosis (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Cutaneous arteriolosclerosis is significantly and independently associated with age. Thus, skin biopsy seems not to be necessary for the diagnosis of HLU but only for a differential diagnosis. (C) 2018 S.

However, this score has never been formally validated in French. We thus performed a translation and a linguistic validation of the Raynaud's condition score through a forward/backward translations process followed by an expert review and cognitive patient interviews. The translations led to a French version of the Raynaud's condition score that was linguistically valid, and conceptually equivalent to the original English version.

More recently, the use of video-capillaroscopy has allowed computer storage of capillaroscopic images (video-capillaroscopy), enabling evaluation of changes in capillaroscopic abnormalities during the follow-up of patients with systemic sclerosis or mixed connective tissue disease. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of the nail-fold dermal capillaries and of their organization can readily distinguish between a normal capillaroscopic pattern in primary Raynaud phenomenon and a specific sclerodermic pattern in secondary Raynaud phenomenon carrying a very high risk of systemic sclerosis. Apart from its important role as a diagnostic tool for distinguishing between primary and secondary Raynaud phenomenon, capillaroscopy is now used to predict the risk of development of digital ulcers and of future visceral complications in patients with systemic sclerosis. Moreover, nail-fold capillaroscopy is essential for differential diagnosis between connective tissue diseases, for the etiologic diagnosis of digital necrosis and diffuse interstitial lung disease, and in sclerodermiform syndromes.

Timolol maleate has been reported as displaying efficacy in healing of VLUs. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of timolol maleate gel in the management of hard-to-heal VLUs and to assess its safety as a topical agent during 12 weeks of use in combination with conventional treatment. Methods: A prospective, phase-II randomised-controlled trial with a sample size based on Fleming's one-stage design (P0 = 0.25, P1 = 0.45, alpha = 0.1, beta = 0.2) was planned. Patients with VLUs present for >= 24 weeks and with >= 50% granulation tissue were included. One drop of sustained-release timolol gel (Timoptol (R) LP 0.5%, Santen, Tampere, Finland) per 6 cm(2) VLU area was applied every 2 days for 12 weeks in timolol-treated patients, as adjuvant therapy to the standard care protocol (interface dressing and multilayer venous compression). Controls received standard care alone. The primary endpoint was to obtain >= 40% reduction in ulcer area at week 12 (W12). Results: Forty-three patients were randomised to the study, with 40 receiving at least one treatment and included in the analysis: 21 timolol-treated patients and 19 controls (females: 70%; median age: 72.5 [range 35-93] years). At W12, >= 40% ulcer-area reduction was achieved in 14/21 (67%) timolol-treated patients vs. 6/19 (32%) controls. No serious adverse events occurred. Local wound infections not requiring systemic antibiotics occurred in 5 cases in the timolol group and in one case in the controls. Conclusions: These results support the benefit and safety of using timolol maleate to manage hard-to-heal VLUs, but confirmation is required in a larger multicentre randomised phase-III study.

Settings: Geriatric acute care ward. Measurements: Scurvy symptoms (one or more among perifollicular hyperkeratosis, petechiae or bruises, haemorrhagic features caused by venous puncture, severe gingivitis). We compared associated diseases, nutritional status, need for assistance for feeding, serum albumin, transthyretin, B9 and B12 vitamins, iron status and Serum Ascorbic Acid Level (SAAL) and outcome (in-hospital mortality) between scurvy and scurvy free patients. Results: 18 patients with clinical symptoms of scurvy (scurvy group) were identified out of 145 consecutive patients (12%). They were compared to 23 consecutive control patients with no clinical symptoms of scurvy (scurvy-free group). SAAL was significantly lower (1.09 +/- 1.06 vs 4.87 +/- 4.2 mg.L-1, p<.001) and vitamin C deficiency more frequent (94 vs 30 %, p<.001) in the scurvy group. Moreover, in scurvy group, coronary heart disease (39 vs 9 %, p=.028), need for assistance for feeding (56 vs 13 %, p=.006) and in-hospital deaths (44 vs 9 %, p=.012) were more frequent. Conclusion: Ninety-four percent of patients with clinical symptoms of scurvy had vitamin C deficiency. Our results suggest that in hospitalized elderly patients, clinical symptoms allow scurvy diagnosis. Scurvy could be a frequent disease in elderly patients admitted to acute geriatric ward.","[Raynaud-Simon, A.] Hop Bichat Claude Bernard, Serv Geriatrie, Paris, France; [Raynaud-Simon, A.] Fac Med Denis Diderot, Paris, France; [Cohen-Bittan, J.; Verny, M.; Boddaert, J.] CHU Hop Pitie Salpetriere, Ctr Geriatrie, Paris, France; [Gouronnec, A.; Pautas, E.] Hop Charles Foix, Unite Geriatrie Aigue, Ivry, France; [Cohen-Bittan, J.; Verny, M.; Boddaert, J.] Univ Paris 06, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Senet, P.] Hop Charles Foix, Unite Nutr Geriatr, Ivry, France; [Senet, P.] Univ Paris 06, AP HP, F-75252 Paris 05, France",,"Boddaert, J (通讯作者)，Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Ctr Geriatrie, 47-83 Blvd Hop, F-75651 Paris 13, France.",jacques.boddaert@psl.aphp.fr,,"Verny, Marc/0000-0001-7960-9705",,,,,28,28,28,0,12,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1279-7707,1760-4788,,J NUTR HEALTH AGING,J.

Herein we report a case of bultous eruption; we discuss the diagnostic approach and the related therapeutic implications. Patients and methods. - A 63-year-old man presented a buttous periumbilical eruption two months after initiation of PD. Cultures of laboratory samples ruled out an infectious origin and systemic corticosteroids initiated at 0.5 mg/kg for suspected eosinophilic peritonitis produced significant improvement of the cutaneous eruption. Recurrence of the bultous eruption was observed upon dose-reduction of the corticosteroid. Skin histology showed a clinical picture of eczema and direct immunofiuorescence was negative. Patch testing was carried out using the European Standard Battery comprising antiseptic, cosmetic and plastic series; a semi-open test was performed with the dressing used for PD, and ROAT was carried out on the povidone iodine (Betadinen (TM)) 10% used for topical care during PD. The patch testing and ROAT were positive (++), confirming contact dermatitis due to Betadine(TM). The eruption totally disappeared on substitution of BetadineTM by chlorhexidine for topical antisepsis of the PD catheter, thus enabling PD to be continued rather than instituting hemodialysis. Discussion. - Allergic contact dermatitis around a PD catheter is a rare and little-known complication. In the present case, ROAT testing showed sensitization to Betadine (TM) and enabled an alternative antisepsis solution to be found, allowing PD to be continued. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Objectives: To assess the prevalence, the factors associated with remission, and the long-term remission with and without treatment during CLE. Methods: Longitudinal cohort study including biopsy-proven patients with CLE seen between November 1, 2019 and April 30, 2021, with at least 6 months of follow-up after diagnosis. Demographic data, CLE subtypes, remission status, and treatments were recorded. Remission was defined by a Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index activity score of 0. Long-term remission was defined by remission >3 years. Results: Among 141 patients included (81% of women), 93 (66%) were in remission at last follow-up with a median duration since diagnosis of 11.4 years (interquartile range, 4.2-24.7). Long-term remission was observed in 22 (19%) of 114 patients with at least 3 years of follow-up, including 5 (4.4%) with no systemic treatment. Active smoking (odds ratio, 0.22 [95%CI: 0.05-0.97]; P=.04) and discoid CLE lesions (odds ratio, 0.14 [95%CI, 0.04-0.48]; P=.004) were associated with a lower risk of long-term remission. Limitations: Partial retrospective data collection and tertiary center population. Conclusion: Long-term remission is rare in CLE and negatively associated with active smoking and discoid CLE.","[Fayard, Damien; Frances, Camille; Senet, Patricia; Barbaud, Annick; Chasset, Francois] Sorbonne Univ, Hop Tenon, AP HP, Fac Med,Serv Dermatol & Allergol, 4 Rue Chine, F-75970 Paris 20, France; [Fayard, Damien] CHU Gabriel Montpied, Serv Med Interne, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Amoura, Zahir; Breillat, Paul; Mathian, Alexis] Sorbonne Univ, Grp Hosp Pitie Salpetriere,Fac Med,Serv Med Inter, AP HP,French Natl Referral Ctr Syst Lupus Erythem, Inst E3M,Inserm UMRS,Ctr Immunol & Malad Infect C, Paris, France; [Arnaud, Laurent] Univ Strasbourg, Hop Univ Strasbourg, Serv Rhumatol, Ctr Natl References Malad Systemigues & Autoimmun, Strasbourg, France",,"Chasset, F (通讯作者)，Sorbonne Univ, Hop Tenon, AP HP, Fac Med,Serv Dermatol & Allergol, 4 Rue Chine, F-75970 Paris 20, France.",francois.chasset@aphp.fr,,,,,,,33,0,0,1,1,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0190-9622,1097-6787,,J AM ACAD DERMATOL,J.

A global quantitative model is proposed for analyzing the tunnel conductance in both parallel and antiparallel configuration. Three contributions to the temperature dependence can be distinguished. The first one is governed by the Bloch law for the temperature dependence of the magnetization of the electrodes. The second one is unpolarized and follows a power-law associated with a hopping mechanism. Although these two mechanisms are predominant in the decrease of tunnel magnetoresistance with temperature, a third contribution must be considered. This term results from a thermally activated decrease of the effective spin polarization, introduced by an Arrhenius law. It appears in either the parallel or antiparallel conductance, depending on the interface chemical doping, and could then be related to a symmetry dependent diffusion process. Finally, this global analysis appears universal, as it can well fit the temperature dependence of all samples.","[Bellouard, C.; Lu, Y.; Duluard, A.; Senet, C.; Hehn, M.] Univ Lorraine, CNRS, Inst Jean Lamour, UMR 7198, Campus Artem,2 Allee Andre Guinier, F-54011 Nancy, France; [Negulescu, B.] Univ Tours, UFR Sci & Tech, Grp Rech Mat Microelect Acoust & Nanotechnol, Parc Grandmont,Batiment E, F-37200 Tours, France; [Maloufi, N.] Univ Lorraine, Lab Etud Microstruct & Mecan Mat LEM3, UMR 7239, F-57045 Metz 1, France; [Tiusan, C.] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Ctr Superconduct Spintron & Surface Sci, Str Memorandumului 28, RO-400114 Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Tiusan, C.] CNRS, DGDR, DR06, Paris, France",,"Bellouard, C (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, CNRS, Inst Jean Lamour, UMR 7198, Campus Artem,2 Allee Andre Guinier, F-54011 Nancy, France.",christine.bellouard@univ-lorraine.fr,"Lu, Yuan/M-9239-2014; Tiusan, Coriolan V./F-1564-2011; Tiusan, Coriolan Viorel/ABB-4399-2021","Lu, Yuan/0000-0003-3337-8205; Tiusan, Coriolan V./0000-0003-1338-3867; Tiusan, Coriolan Viorel/0000-0003-1338-3867; Negulescu, Beatrice/0000-0001-7218-9859","French PIA project Lorraine Universite d'Excellence [ANR-15-IDEX-04-LUE]; joint French National Research Agency (ANR)-National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) ENSEMBLE Project [ANR-14-0028-01, NNSFC 61411136001]; UEFISCDI agency [PN-III-P4-ID-PCE-2016-0143, 22/12.07.2017]","French PIA project Lorraine Universite d'Excellence; joint French National Research Agency (ANR)-National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) ENSEMBLE Project(French National Research Agency (ANR)); UEFISCDI agency(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI))","This work was supported by the French PIA project Lorraine Universite d'Excellence, reference ANR-15-IDEX-04-LUE.

The expression of this epitope (AF1-MP) during experimental candidal vaginitis was studied in two strains of C. albicans (3153 and CA-2) which were equally vaginopathic but differed in the mode of hypha formation in the vagina. In both strains, immunofluorescence of vaginal samples, taken 1 h after challenge, revealed an intense, MAb AF1-specific labelling of the yeast cells. This labelling was very scarce in fungal cells taken at 24 h and on subsequent days during the development of filamentous forms. Electron-microscopic gold immunolabelling observations showed that molecules carrying AF1-MP spanned the entire cell wall in the initial yeast cells but were absent on the cell surface and in the outermost, capsular layer of the cell wall of the germ tubes and filamentous forms. In both strains, at any time and for any form of intravaginal growth, AF1-MP was clearly expressed in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic vesicles, and was fully incorporated into the inner layers of the cell wall. As seen by immunofluorescence, the vaginal fluid from C. albicans-infected rats did not hinder the expression of AF1-MP on the yeast cell surface in vitro. In electron-microscopic gold immunolabelling, a hypha specific MAb (3D9) labelled the surface of the hyphal but not of the yeast cells of C. albicans harvested from rat vagina. Overall, these data strongly suggest that cell surface expression of MP antigen is modulated during intravaginal growth and morphogenesis of C. albicans.","IST SUPER SANITA, DEPT ULTRASTRUCT, I-00161 ROME, ITALY; FAC PHARM ANGERS, IMMUNOL & PARASITOL LAB, ANGERS, FRANCE; IST SUPER SANITA, DEPT BACTERIOL & MED MYCOL, ROME, ITALY",,,,"STRINGARO, ANNARITA/E-9092-2015; Molinari, Agnese/E-7588-2015; Cassone, Antonio/J-4666-2019; Molinari, Agnese/AAC-2918-2021; DE BERNARDIS, FLAVIA/C-9589-2016","STRINGARO, ANNARITA/0000-0002-0143-2978; Molinari, Agnese/0000-0002-9592-5465; Molinari, Agnese/0000-0002-9592-5465; DE BERNARDIS, FLAVIA/0000-0001-9440-8629",,,,,48,38,40,0,0,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0019-9567,1098-5522,,INFECT IMMUN,Infect.

The amorphous FeSn and FeGd alloys have been grown by co-evaporation. Specific growth conditions allow to induce an uniaxial anisotropy in both alloys in a parallel direction. After saturation of the bilayers under a positive field, the hysteresis loop of one of the layer is shifted towards a positive field H-E. The sign of the exchange bias field H-E is shown to be due to the antiferromagnetic coupling between the net magnetizations of both alloys. The field H-E is studied as a function of the thickness of each layer and of the temperature. Using ac-susceptibility measurements and polarized neutron reflectometry, it is shown that the reversal of magnetization of the bilayers is dominated by the presence of a domain wall at the interface. This exchange bias system is shown to act as a potential well for the magnetic domain wall. Within this assumption and thanks to a precise magnetic characterization of each alloy, the evolution of H-E with the thickness of the layers is well reproduced using simple one-dimensional analytical models for the domain wall or a more elaborate numerical approach.","Univ Nancy 1, Phys Mat Lab, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; Inst Max Von Laue Paul Langevin, F-38042 Grenoble 9, France",,"Canet, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nancy 1, Phys Mat Lab, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.",bellouard@lpm.u-nancy.fr,"Chatelain, Christophe/N-9695-2019; Chatelain, Christophe/G-1545-2011; Mangin, Stephane/S-9013-2019","Chatelain, Christophe/0000-0002-5374-1799; Chatelain, Christophe/0000-0002-5374-1799; Mangin, Stephane/0000-0001-6046-0437",,,,,30,15,15,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1434-6028,1434-6036,,EUR PHYS J B,Eur.

Meningococcal meningitis, by contrast, usually features clinical meningeal signs and biochemical markers of inflammation with elevated white blood cell count (pleiocytosis) in the CSF. Cases of typical symptomatic meningitis without these biochemical features are uncommon in adults.Case presentationA 21-year-old male presented with meningococcal purpura fulminans and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome requiring hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit. Despite typical meningeal clinical signs, lumbar puncture showed no pleiocytosis, normal glycorachia and normal proteinorachia, whereas the lactate concentration in the CSF was high (5.8mmol/L). CSF culture showed a high inoculum of serogroup C meningococci. On day 2, after initial improvement, a recurrence of hypotension led to the diagnosis of acute meningococcal myocarditis, which evolved favourably within a week. During the hospitalization, distal ischemic and necrotic lesions were observed, predominantly on the fingertips, which were treated with local and systemic vasodilators.ConclusionsWe report a rare case of adult meningococcal disease characterized by an intermediate form of meningitis between purulent meningitis and meningeal inoculation from fulminant meningococcal septicaemia, without classical signs of biological inflammation. It highlights the diagnostic value of CSF lactate, which may warrant administration of a meningeal dosing regimen of beta-lactam antibiotics. This case also demonstrates the potential severity of meningococcal myocarditis; we discuss its pathophysiology, which is distinct from other sepsis-related cardiomyopathies. Finally, the observed effects of vasodilators on the meningococcal skin ischemia in this case encourages future studies to assess their efficacy in DIC-associated necrosis.","[Hage-Sleiman, Mehdi; Boissan, Mathieu] Tenon Univ Hosp, AP HP, Biochem Lab, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France; [Derre, Nicolas; Fartoukh, Muriel; Garnier, Marc] Tenon Univ Hosp, AP HP, Medicosurg Intens Care Unit, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France; [Verdet, Charlotte] Grp Hosp Univ Paris Est, AP HP, Bacteriol Lab, 184 Rue Faubourg St Antoine, F-75012 Paris, France; [Pialoux, Gilles] Tenon Univ Hosp, AP HP, Infect Dis Dept, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France; [Gaudin, Olivier] Tenon Univ Hosp, AP HP, Anatomopathol Lab, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France; [Senet, Patricia] Tenon Univ Hosp, AP HP, Dermatol Dept, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France; [Fartoukh, Muriel; Boissan, Mathieu; Garnier, Marc] Sorbonne Univ, Sch Med, Paris 6, Paris, France; [Boissan, Mathieu] Sorbonne Univ, INSERM, UMR S 938, St Antoine Res Ctr, Paris, France; [Garnier, Marc] Tenon Univ Hosp, AP HP, Anaesthesiol & Intens Care Med Dept, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France",,"Garnier, M (通讯作者)，Tenon Univ Hosp, AP HP, Medicosurg Intens Care Unit, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France.;Garnier, M (通讯作者)，Sorbonne Univ, Sch Med, Paris 6, Paris, France.",marc.garnier@aphp.fr,"Garnier, Marc/J-6438-2017",,,,,,32,3,4,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2334,,,BMC INFECT DIS,BMC Infect.

Platelet products have been proposed as adjuvant therapy for wound heating. We undertook this study to determine the healing effect of topically applied frozen autologous platelets (FA-P) on chronic venous ulcers, compared with effect of placebo, and whether use of topical FAP modifies local expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in wound fluid. Methods. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was carried out in institutional practice, with ambulatory patients with proved chronic venous leg ulcers. In all patients, whole venous blood was drawn for preparation of FAR FAT or normal saline solution was applied three times per week for up to 12 weeks, together with hydrocolloids and standardized compression bandages. Leg ulcer surface was assessed with numerical pictures. IL-8, VEGF, KGF, and TIMP-1 levels were determined (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in wound fluid after each 4 weeks of treatment. Results: Fifteen patients were randomized into two groups with comparable leg ulcer characteristics. Mean percent reduction in ulcer area was 26.2% in the FAT group versus 15.2% in the placebo group (P = .94). One ulcer in each group was completely healed at study end. Levels of TIMP-1 increased significantly during FAP treatment. IL- 8 concentration was significantly lower in wound fluid of healing ulcers than in the fluid of nonhealing ulcers, in both FAP and placebo groups. Growth factor levels were not modified with FAT treatment. Conclusion: Topical autologous; platelets have no significant adjuvant effect on healing of chronic venous leg ulcers and increased wound fluid TIMP-1 concentration. Ulcer healing is associated with a decrease in wound fluid IL-8.","Unite Therapie Cellulaire, Clin Transfusionelle, F-75475 Paris 10, France; Etab Francais Sang, Paris, France; Hop St Louis, Ctr Invest Clin, Paris, France; Hop Charles Foix, Serv Geriat 5, Ivry, France",,"Dosquet, C (通讯作者)，Unite Therapie Cellulaire, Clin Transfusionelle, 1 Ave Claude Vellefaux, F-75475 Paris 10, France.",dosquet@chu-stlouis.fr,,,,,,,38,91,93,0,4,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0741-5214,,,J VASC SURG,J.

In poultry, low pathogenic avian influenza A viruses, metapneumoviruses, infectious bronchitis virus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, Mycoplasma spp. Escherichia coli and/or Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale in turkeys are considered as key co-infectious agents of RS. Aspergillus sp., Pasteurella multocida, Avibacterium paragallinarum or Chlamydia psittaci may also be involved in respiratory outbreaks. An innovative quantitative PCR method, based on a nanofluidic technology, has the ability to screen up to 96 samples with 96 pathogen-specific PCR primers, at the same time, in one run of real-time quantitative PCR. This platform was used for the screening of avian respiratory pathogens: 15 respiratory agents, including viruses, bacteria and fungi potentially associated with respiratory infections of poultry, were targeted. Primers were designed and validated for SYBR green real-time quantitative PCR and subsequently validated on the Biomark high throughput PCR nanofluidic platform (Fluidigm (c), San Francisco, CA, USA). As a clinical assessment, tracheal swabs were sampled from turkeys showing RS and submitted to this panel assay. Beside systematic detection of E. coli, avian metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma synoviae were frequently detected, with distinctive co-infection patterns between French and Moroccan flocks. This proof-of-concept study illustrates the potential of such panel assays for unveiling respiratory co-infection profiles in poultry.","[Croville, Guillaume; Foret, Charlotte; Heuillard, Pauline; Senet, Alexis; Delpont, Mattias; Ducatez, Mariette F.; Guerin, Jean-Luc] Univ Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, IHAP, Toulouse, France; [Kichou, Faouzi] Inst Agron & Vet Hassan II, Rabat, Morocco",,"Guerin, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, IHAP, Toulouse, France.",jl.guerin@envt.fr,"Croville, Guillaume/AAQ-6761-2021; KICHOU, Faouzi/D-6336-2018; Delpont, Mattias/AAQ-8409-2020","Croville, Guillaume/0000-0001-7577-2089; KICHOU, Faouzi/0000-0003-1147-9128; Delpont, Mattias/0000-0002-1361-8956; GUERIN, Jean-Luc/0000-0001-7770-4012",French Institut Carnot de Sante Animale (ICSA); Hubert Curien Partnership (PHC) [PRAD/11-07/24193]; French Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-15-LCV1-0003-01],French Institut Carnot de Sante Animale (ICSA); Hubert Curien Partnership (PHC); French Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This project was funded by the French Institut Carnot de Sante Animale (ICSA) and was partly performed in the framework of a Hubert Curien Partnership (PHC) [grant PRAD/11-07/24193 PC, Campus France, entitled Emerging diseases of turkeys in Morocco].

Healthy skin biopsies may prove useful in diagnosis of the condition. Herein we report a case of ivLBCL diagnosed using this type of examination, and we provide a literature review to determine the sensitivity of such testing. Patients and methods. - A 67-year-old woman was hospitalised for unexplained prolonged fever (UPF) and impaired general well-being. Laboratory tests revealed inflammatory syndrome, elevated LDH > 2000 IU/L, hepatic cytolysis and decreased prothrombin time at 47 %. Analysis for infection and medical imaging ruled out both an infectious or inflammatory origin and solid tumour. A healthy skin biopsy enabled confirmation of the diagnosis of ivLBCL. Discussion. - This clinical case illustrates the value of healthy skin biopsy in establishing a diagnosis of ivLBCL in patients hospitalised for UPF. Following a systematic literature review in PubMed/Medline, we included eight studies involving at least three patients designed to assess the value of healthy skin biopsy in the diagnosis of ivLBCL. The diagnostic sensitivity of this approach ranged from 67% to 100%, with a sensitivity of 100% being seen in four of the eight studies. Details of the biopsy sites were available in three studies and diagnostic sensitivity was similar overall between samples taken from the thigh, abdomen and arms. Conclusion. - Healthy skin biopsy sampling from at least two sites constitutes a sensitive and relatively non-invasive procedure for early diagnosis of ivLBCL. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The study of the clearance of blastoconidia of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata showed that these cells disappeared quickly from the bloodstream. Microscopic observation of blood samples, stained by Calcofluor white or May Grunwald Giemsa, demonstrated the rapid attachment of platelets to fungal elements of all the Candida spp, tested, The attachment of murine platelets to C, albicans cells, observed by scanning electron microscopy, revealed morphological changes. The platelets lost their discoid shape, generated pseudopodia, and flattened against the yeast cells, The reversibility of platelet binding to C, albicans by chelating agents suggests a cation-dependent link.

Peripheral arterial disease, increasingly studied during SSc, is responsible for digital ulcers, associated with a high risk of amputation. The aim of our study was to assess the frequency of lower limb arterial impairment in SSc patients by measuring ankle-brachial index (ABI), toe pressure (TP), and toe-brachial index (TBI). Methods Systemic sclerosis patients were included prospectively during 1 year in Tenon and Saint-Antoine Hospitals, Paris. Clinical and biological data were recorded. For each patient, ABI, TP, and TBI were measured and an arterial duplex ultrasonography was prescribed in case of abnormal results. Results Eighty-six patients were included (94% women, median age 62 years). Only 24% of them had no lower limb hemodynamic vascular abnormalities; 44% had an isolated microvascular abnormality (normal ABI and TBI<0.75); 31% had at least a macrovascular injury associated or not with microvascular impairment (abnormal ABI) and 12.6% had a TP<50 mmHg. During follow-up, there was a trend towards association of low TBI with more major adverse event (all-cause mortality, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and lower limb ischemic manifestations) than normal TBI. Conclusion By measuring ABI and TP, we showed that 76% of SSc patients had hemodynamic arterial lower limb abnormalities related to macro- and/or microvascular impairment and that 28% had vascular stiffness. In SSc patients, ABI is not an accurate tool to detect lower limb arterial disease, likely due to underlying micro- and macrovascular changes.","[Cassius, Charles; Monfort, Jean-Benoit; Baudot, Nathalie Abdoucheli; Frances, Camille; Barbaud, Annick; Senet, Patricia] Hop Tenon, AP HP, Dermatol Dept, F-75020 Paris, France; [Cassius, Charles] Hop St Louis, AP HP, Dermatol Dept, 1 Ave Claude Vellefaux, F-75010 Paris, France; [Cassius, Charles] Univ Paris, Inst Rech St Louis, INSERM, U976,HIPI UNIT, F-75010 Paris, France; [Seta, Vannina] Hop Cochin, AP HP, Dermatol Dept, F-75014 Paris, France; [Riviere, Sebastien; Mekinian, Arsene] Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Internal Med Dept, F-75012 Paris, France",,"Cassius, C (通讯作者)，Hop Tenon, AP HP, Dermatol Dept, F-75020 Paris, France.;Cassius, C (通讯作者)，Hop St Louis, AP HP, Dermatol Dept, 1 Ave Claude Vellefaux, F-75010 Paris, France.;Cassius, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris, Inst Rech St Louis, INSERM, U976,HIPI UNIT, F-75010 Paris, France.",Charles.cassius@aphp.fr,", barbaud/AAZ-7250-2021; Cassius, Charles/L-9211-2019","Cassius, Charles/0000-0002-5087-4414",,,,,16,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0770-3198,1434-9949,,CLIN RHEUMATOL,Clin.

After determining the general orientation of the clines of allele frequencies, we analysed the cline shapes along the direction of maximum gradient. Eight of the ten clines are best described by steep central steps with coincident positions and an average width of 8.9 km (support limits 7.6-12.4) flanked by tails of introgression, indicating the existence of a barrier to gene flow and only weak selection on the loci studied. We derived estimates of migration from linkage disequilibrium in the centre of the zone, and by applying isolation by distance methods to microsatellite data from some of these populations. These give concordant estimates of sigma = 0.5-0.8 km generation-(1)/(2). The barrier to gene flow is of the order of 20 kin (support limits 14-28), and could be explained by selection of a few per cent at 43-120 under-dominant loci that reduces the mean fitness in the central populations to 0.45. Some of the clines appear symmetrical, whereas others are strongly asymmetrical, and two loci appear to have escaped the central barrier to gene flow, reflecting the differential action of selection on different parts of the genome. Asymmetry is always in the direction of more introgression into Musculus, indicating either a general progression of domesticus into the musculus territory, possibly mediated by differential behaviour, or past movement of the hybrid zone in the opposite direction, impeded by potential geographical barriers to migration in domesticus territory.

Kikuchi disease-like inflammatory pattern (KLIP) has been described in cutaneous lesions as similar pathological features in patients without lymph node involvement and as a potential clue for the diagnosis of lupus. We aimed to describe KLIP-associated clinical and immunological features in lupus patients with a retrospective case-control study. Methods Thirteen cases of KLIP were included as well as thirty-nine age- and sex-matched control lupus patients without KLIP. At the time of KLIP diagnosis, 4/13 patients (31%) had isolated cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and 9/13 had (69%) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) including 6 (46%) with severe haematological, lung, cardiac or renal disease. KLIP features were observed in skin biopsies of different clinical presentations. Results Compared with our control group, KLIP patients more frequently had SLE 9/13 (69%) versus 8/39 (21%) (OR 12.9; IC95% [2.86-58.2]; p = 0.0004) and more frequently severe SLE. Two out of four CLE exhibiting KLIP lesions (50%) developed severe SLE with cardiac or renal involvement after 12 and 24 months, respectively. Treatment with thalidomide 100 mg/day allowed rapid and complete clearance of cutaneous lesions in 6/6 KLIP patients. The need to use thalidomide tended to be more frequent in KLIP patients than in controls. Conclusion Our study suggests that KLIP features in lupus skin lesions are associated with SLE and severe systemic features. Despite a limited number of isolated CLE patients with KLIP features in the skin, this observation may warrant closer follow-up on patients with a higher risk of developing SLE.","[Lalevee, Sophie; Moguelet, Philippe] Hop Tenon, AP HP, Serv Anatomopathol, Paris, France; [Hurabielle, Charlotte] UCSF Internal Med, San Francisco, CA USA; [Senet, Patricia; Barbaud, Annick; Frances, Camille; Chasset, Francois] Sorbonne Univ, Hop Tenon, AP HP, Serv Dermatol & Allergol, Paris, France; [Pha, Micheline; Amoura, Zahir] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Serv Med Interne 2, Ctr Natl Reference Lupus Syst, Paris, France; [Riviere, Sebastien] Sorbonne Univ, Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Fac Med,Serv Med Interne, Paris, France; [Barbaud, Annick] Med Sorbonne Univ, Inst Pierre Louis Epidemiol & Sante Publ, INSERM, Paris, France",,"Chasset, F (通讯作者)，Sorbonne Univ, Hosp Tenon, Serv Dermatol & Allergol, 4 Rue Chine, F-75970 Paris 2A, France.",francois.chasset@aphp.fr,", barbaud/AAZ-7250-2021","PHA, Micheline/0000-0003-3727-2782; Lalevee, Sophie/0000-0003-0262-2754",,,,,10,0,0,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0961-2033,1477-0962,,LUPUS,Lupus,MAR,2021.0,30,3,,,,,473,477,,10.1177/0961203320978519,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0961203320978519,,,5,Rheumatology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Rheumatology,QR4WH,33292039.0,Green Submitted,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000625215900013,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, it was shown that folding of the intrinsically disordered protein, eIF4E-binding protein isoform 2 (4E-BP2), can be induced by multisite phosphorylation. Here, the principles that govern the folding of phosphorylated 4E-BP2 (pT37pT46 4E-BP2(18-62)) are investigated by analyzing canonical and replica exchange molecular dynamics trajectories, generated with the coarse-grained united-residue force field, in terms of local and global motions and the time dependence of formation of contacts between Cas of selected pairs of residues. The key residues involved in the folding of the pT37pT46 4E-BP2(18-62) are elucidated by this analysis. The correlations between local and global motions are identified. Moreover, for a better understanding of the physics of the formation of the folded state, the experimental structure of the pT37pT46 4E-BP2(18-62) is analyzed in terms of a kink (heteroclinic standing wave solution) of a generalized discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. It is shown that without molecular dynamics simulations the kinks are able to identify not only the phosphorylated sites of protein, the key players in folding, but also the reasons for the weak stability of the pT37pT46 4E-BP2(18-62).","[Sieradzan, Adam K.] Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland; [Korneev, Anatolii; Begun, Alexander; Molochkov, Alexander; Niemi, Antti J.] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Pacific Quantum Ctr, Vladivostok 690922, Russia; [Kachlishvili, Khatuna; Scheraga, Harold A.; Senet, Patrick; Maisuradze, Gia G.] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, UMR 6303, CNRS, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Niemi, Antti J.] Univ Tours, Lab Math & Phys Theor, CNRS, UMR 6083,Federat Denis Poisson, F-37200 Tours, France; [Niemi, Antti J.] Stockholm Univ, NORDITA, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Niemi, Antti J.] Uppsala Univ, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Niemi, Antti J.] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",,"Maisuradze, GG (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",gm56@cornell.edu,"Molochkov, Alexander/A-8594-2014; Sieradzan, Adam/ABC-3552-2020; Begun, Alexander/M-9576-2019; Korneev, Anatolii/AAR-2885-2021","Molochkov, Alexander/0000-0002-3578-703X; Sieradzan, Adam/0000-0002-2426-3644; Korneev, Anatolii/0000-0002-5282-0460; Begun, Alexander/0000-0001-8399-0617",National Institutes of Health [GM-14312]; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia [0657-2020-0015]; Carl Trygger Foundation [CTS 18:276]; Swedish Research Council [2018-04411]; COST Action [CA17139]; National Science Center (Poland) [UMO-2017/27/B/ST4/00926]; EIPHI Graduate School [ANR-17-EURE-0002]; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte; European Union through the PO FEDER-FSE Bourgogne 2014/2020 programs,"National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia; Carl Trygger Foundation; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); National Science Center (Poland)(National Science Centre, Poland); EIPHI Graduate School; Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte); European Union through the PO FEDER-FSE Bourgogne 2014/2020 programs","We thank Dr. Adam Liwo for helpful discussions and comments.

Methods This work is based on the baseline data of the SCLEROCAP multicenter cohort of SSc patients. Finger systolic blood pressure was measured with laser Doppler flowmetry, and the FBPI was obtained as its ratio over the ipsilateral brachial systolic blood pressure. An FBPI of <0.70 was used as the diagnostic criterion for occlusive arterial disease of the upper limbs. Thus, the prevalence of defined arterial disease as well as its clinical, biologic, and capillaroscopic correlates were evaluated. Results Among 326 enrolled patients, 177 (54.3%) met the criterion for arterial disease (FBPI <0.70). No association was found with the type of SSc nor with the type of associated antinuclear antibodies, but a significant association was found with the duration of the disease (P < 0.001), the capillaroscopic pattern (P < 0.001), and most strikingly with the presence of digital ulcers (42.9% versus 13.4%; P < 0.001). A quantitative relationship was found between the FBPI and the prevalence of digital ulcers and was shown to be independent from the capillaroscopic pattern. Conclusion This cross-sectional study shows a high prevalence of arterial disease of the upper limbs in patients with SSc. FBPI appears to be a strong and independent predictor of digital ulcers. This study suggests that both macro- and microangiopathy are contributing to the ischemic damage of the fingertips.","[Blaise, Sophie; Imbert, Bernard; Carpentier, Patrick] Grenoble Alpes Univ Hosp, Grenoble, France; [Boulon, Carine; Mangin, Marion; Constans, Joel] St Andre Hosp, Bordeaux, France; [Senet, Patricia] Tenon Hosp, Paris, France; [Lazareth, Isabelle] St Joseph Hosp, Paris, France; [Lapebie, Francois-Xavier] Hop Rangueil, Toulouse, France; [Lacroix, Philippe] Univ Hosp, Limoges, France",,"Blaise, S (通讯作者)，Grenoble Alpes Univ Hosp, Dept Vasc Med, CS 10217, F-38043 Grenoble 09, France.",SBlaise@chu-grenoble.fr,,,"Societe Francaise de Medecine Vasculaire; Societe Francaise de Microcirculation; Actelion Pharmaceuticals, France","Societe Francaise de Medecine Vasculaire; Societe Francaise de Microcirculation; Actelion Pharmaceuticals, France","Supported by the Societe Francaise de Medecine Vasculaire, the Societe Francaise de Microcirculation, and Actelion Pharmaceuticals, France.",,17,1,1,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2151-464X,2151-4658,,ARTHRIT CARE RES,Arthritis Care Res.,MAY,2022.0,74,5,,,,,828,832,,10.1002/acr.24527,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/acr.24527,,MAR 2022,5,Rheumatology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Rheumatology,0S8ZN,33278327.0,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000770156400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our aim was to determine whether the clinical trials' results translate into routine management of such wounds, by pooling the data from real-life observational studies. Method: Observational studies, conducted in France and Germany, evaluating current practices in patients suffering from non-selected chronic wounds treated with a TLC-NOSF dressing were identified. Demographic data, baseline description of wounds and description of their evolution during treatment were extracted and combined. We used two main indicators of clinical outcomes to measure the impact of the TLC-NOSF dressing on this population: time to wound closure and time to 50% reduction of the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) score. Results: In total, data from 10,220 patients were included, with 7903 leg ulcers (LUs), 1306 diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and 1011 pressure ulcers (PUs). The overall closure rate was 30.8 % [95 % confidence interval (CI): 29.9-31.7 %]. While the country, patient age, and number of wounds were identified as independent prognosis factors of healing, the most significant were wound duration and baseline area. The delay in initiating TLC-NOSF dressings treatment was also found to be significant. Overall the average time to complete closure was 112.5 days [95% CI: 105.8-119.3] for LUs, 98.1 days [95 % CI: 88.8-107.5] for DFUs and 119.5 days [95% CI: 94.6144.3] for PUs. Based on a subgroup analysis of the French cohort, time to closure is substantially shorter for wounds treated with the TLC-NOSF dressing as a first-line intervention compared with those where it has been prescribed as a second-line intervention. Conclusion: Compared with available data on time to complete closure of chronic wounds managed by ` standard' care, the data from this pooled data analysis showed healing time is reduced, which is consistent with the results of RCTs on TLC-NOSF. That these data are in agreement with those from the RCTs is testimony to their generalisability and important for routine practice. This indicates that using TLC-NOSF dressings in routine wound management can reduce the healing time of LUs, DFUs and PUs. These data also suggest that the earlier the decision to use this dressing, the shorter the time to closure, whatever the severity and the nature of these chronic wounds.","[Meaum, S.] Rotschild Univ Hosp, APHP, Dept Geriatr, Paris, France; [Augustin, M.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg, Inst Hlth Serv Res Dermatol & Nursing, Hamburg, Germany; [Senet, P.] Univ Hosp Paris Est, APHP, Dept Dermatol, Paris, France; [Kerihuel, J.

Therefore, prevention of the aggregation of folding intermediates is one of the most important problems to overcome. Recently, we studied the origins and prevention of formation of intermediate states with the example of the Formin binding protein 28 (FBP28) WW domain. We demonstrated that the replacement of Leu26 by Asp26 or Trp26 (in similar to 15% of the folding trajectories) can alter the folding scenario from three-state folding, a major folding scenario for the FBP28 WW domain (WT) and its mutants, toward two-state or downhill folding at temperatures below the melting point. Here, for a better understanding of the physics of the formation/elimination of intermediates, (i) the dynamics and energetics of formation of beta-strands in folding, misfolding, and nonfolding trajectories of these mutants (L26D and L26W) is investigated; (ii) the experimental structures of WT, L26D, and L26W are analyzed in terms of a kink (heteroclinic standing wave solution) of a generalized discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. We show that the formation of each beta-strand in folding trajectories is accompanied by the emergence of kinks in internal coordinate space as well as a decrease in local free energy. In particular, the decrease in downhill folding trajectory is similar to 7 kcal/mol, while it varies between 31 and 48 kcal/mol for the three-state folding trajectory. The kink analyses of the experimental structures give new insights into formation of intermediates, which may become a useful tool for preventing aggregation.","[Kachlishvili, Khatuna; Maisuradze, Luka; Scheraga, Harold A.; Senet, Patrick; Maisuradze, Gia G.] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Korneev, Anatolii; Niemi, Antti J.] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Lab Phys Living Matter, Vladivostok 690950, Russia; [Maisuradze, Luka] Yale Univ, Biochem Quantitat Biol Biophys & Struct Biol BQBS, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Liu, Jiaojiao; Niemi, Antti J.] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Molochkov, Alexander] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Lab Phys LiVng Matter, Vladivostok 690950, Russia; [Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, UMR 6303, CNRS, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Niemi, Antti J.] Univ Tours, Lab Math & Phys Theor, Federat Denis Poisson, CNRS,UMR 6083, Parc Grandmt, F-37200 Tours, France; [Niemi, Antti J.] Stockholm Univ, NORDITA, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Maisuradze, GG (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",gm56@cornell.edu,"Korneev, Anatolii/AAR-2885-2021; Molochkov, Alexander/A-8594-2014","Korneev, Anatolii/0000-0002-5282-0460; Molochkov, Alexander/0000-0002-3578-703X",National Institutes of Health [GM-14312]; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia [0657-2020-0015]; Carl Trygger Foundation; Swedish Research Council [2018-04411]; COST Action [CA17139]; Bourgogne Franche-Comte Graduate School EUR-EIPHI [17-EURE-0002],National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia; Carl Trygger Foundation; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission); COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); Bourgogne Franche-Comte Graduate School EUR-EIPHI,"This work was (i) supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (GM-14312) and was (ii) carried out within the state assignment of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia (Grant No. 0657-2020-0015); (iii) the work by A.J.N. has been supported by the Carl Trygger Foundation, by the Swedish Research Council under Contract No. 2018-04411, and by COST Action CA17139; (iv) P.S. acknowledges support from the Bourgogne Franche-Comte Graduate School EUR-EIPHI (17-EURE-0002).

Method: This was an international, prospective, non-comparative, clinical trial, conducted in France and Germany. Eligible participants had a VLU with a wound area of 2-20cm(2), lasting for a maximum of 24 months. For a period of 6 weeks, patients were treated with a new multicomponent compression system in one bandage which was worn day and night, providing high working pressure and moderate resting pressure (UrgoK1). Clinical assessments, wound measurement and photographs were planned at weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6. The primary endpoint was the relative wound area reduction (RWAR) after 6 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included wound closure rate, oedema resolution, change in patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL), acceptability, adherence to the compression therapy, local tolerance, and physician's overall satisfaction with the evaluated compression system. Results: A cohort of 52 patients (52% female, mean age 75.4 +/- 13.0 years) with VLUs, including oedema in 58% of cases, were recruited from 22 centres. At baseline, 42 patients had already been treated with a different compression system. VLUs had been present for 5.6 +/- 4.9 months and had a mean area of 5.7 +/- 4.3cm(2). After 6 weeks of treatment, a median RWAR of 91% (interquartile range: 39.4; 100.0) was achieved. Wound closure was reported in 35% of patients. A RWAR =40% at week 4, predictive of wound healing at 12 weeks, was achieved in 62% of patients. At the final visit, oedema present at baseline was resolved in 57% of patients. Substantial improvements in the HRQoL of the patients were reported with a decrease of the pain/discomfort and anxiety/ depression dimensions. Comfort in wearing the evaluated system was reported as 'very good' or ' good' by 79% of patients, resulting in a high patient adherence to compression therapy. Compared to previous compression systems, half of the patients reported more ease in wearing shoes, and greater satisfaction and comfort with this new system. Nine non- serious adverse events related to the device or its procedure occurred in seven patients. At the final visit, the majority of the physicians were 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with the new compression system overall. Conclusion: The new multicomponent compression system in one bandage has been shown to promote rapid healing of VLUs, reduce oedema, improve HRQoL and to be well tolerated and accepted. It appears to be a viable alternative to existing compression systems.","[Senet, Patricia] Paris Est Univ Hosp, Tenon Hosp, AP HP, Dept Dermatol, Paris, France; [Addala, Azeddine] Hop Edouard Herriot, Dept Vasc Med, Lyon, France; [Leger, Philippe] Pasteur Clin, Wound & Wound Healing Ctr, Toulouse, France; [Chahim, Maxime] Corentin Celton Hosp, Dept Vasc Med, Issy Les Moulineaux, France; [Malloizel, Julie] Rangueil Univ Hosp, Dept Vasc Med, Toulouse, France; [Blaise, Sophie] Albert Michalon Univ Hosp, Dept Vasc Med, Grenoble, France; [Sauvadet, Anne; Tacca, Olivier] URGO Res Innovat & Dev, Clin Dev Dept, Chenove, France; [Stucker, Markus] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Dermatol, Bochum, Germany; [Dissemond, Joachim] Univ Hosp Essen, Dept Dermatol Venerol & Allergol, Essen, Germany",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Paris Est Univ Hosp, Tenon Hosp, AP HP, Dept Dermatol, Paris, France.",patricia.senet@aphp.fr,,,,,,,42,0,0,2,2,MA HEALTHCARE LTD,LONDON,"ST JUDES CHURCH, DULWICH ROAD, LONDON SE24 0PB, ENGLAND",0969-0700,2062-2916,,J WOUND CARE,J.

Pemphigoid is a form of auto-immune bullous dermatosis characterised by the production of antibodies directed against components of hemidesmosomes in the basal membrane. The physiopathological process responsible for unmasking of these antigens is unknown. Pemphigoid is more common in elderly subjects and is most often seen in debilitated subjects. The prevalence of pemphigoid anti-pemphigoid antibodies (anti-PB) is not known in the elderly population presenting no dermatological signs evocative of the disease. We studied the prevalence of anti-PBAg2 antibodies in elderly subjects with no signs of pemphigoid as well as in the correlation between the presence of these antibodies and diagnosis of dementia. Patients and methods. Elderly subjects (aged over 69 years) with no signs of pemphigoid were recruited consecutively in dermatology and geriatrics departments (138 subjects). Details of concomitant medication were recorded for all subjects and clinical examination was performed with calculation of MMS (Mini Mental Score). The subjects were then divided into two groups based on MMS score. The first group comprised subjects without dementia (MMS > 24) while the second comprised subjects with dementia. Serum anti-PBAg2 antibodies were determined by ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence with confirmation by Western blot. Antinuclear antibodies, used as a control for non-specific immune response, were assayed in all serum samples. The prevalence of these antibodies was compared between the two groups. Results. The two groups were comparable in terms of age, sex and presence of dermatological diseases (ulcers, bedsores, erysipelas). Each group comprised 69 subjects. The overall presence of anti-PBAg2 antibodies in subjects with no signs are suggestive of pemphigoid was 3.6%. Presence of anti-PBAg2 antibodies was associated with diagnosis of dementia (p = 0.04; 0% and 7% in groups 1 and 2, respectively). No correlation was seen between the presence of anti-PBAg2 antibodies and concomitant medication or dermatological disease. The overall prevalence of antinuclear antibodies was 14.5% and the figure was similar between the two groups. Discussion. The presence of anti-PBAg2 could be associated with the diagnosis of dementia in elderly subjects.","Univ Paris 07, APHP, Hop Bichat, Serv Dermatol, F-75221 Paris 05, France; Hop Paris, Serv Gerontol, Hop Charles Foix, Ivry, France; Univ Paris 07, Serv Immunol, F-75221 Paris 05, France; Univ Paris 07, Serv Stat, F-75221 Paris 05, France",,"Descamps, V (通讯作者)，Hop Bichat, Assistance Publ Hop Paris, 46 Rue Henru Huchard, F-75018 Paris, France.",vincent.descamps@bch.ap-hop-paris.fr,"Roland, Pascale PNR Nicaise/J-4587-2017",,,,,,24,32,33,0,2,MASSON EDITEUR,MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9,"21 STREET CAMILLE DESMOULINS, ISSY, 92789 MOULINEAUX CEDEX 9, FRANCE",0151-9638,2214-5451,,ANN DERMATOL VENER,Ann.

Objective: To assess the efficacy and tolerance of available treatments for calcinosis cutis based on previously published studies. Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies published in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library during 1980-July 2018. The strength of clinical data was graded according to the modified Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine levels of evidence. Results: In all, 30 studies (288 patients) were included. Eleven therapeutic classes, surgery, and physical treatments were identified as potential treatment options for calcinosis cutis. On the basis of results of a small randomized controlled trial and 4 retrospective studies, low-dose warfarin should not be used for calcinosis cutis (level IB evidence). The results of several studies suggest diltiazem and bisphosphonates might be useful treatment options (level IV). Considering biologic therapies, rituximab has shown promising results in treating both dermatomyositis and systemic sclerosis, whereas tumor necrosis factor inhibitors might be useful for treating juvenile dermatomyositis (level IV). Intralesional sodium thiosulfate might be a promising alternative (level IV). Limitations: Few included studies had a high level of evidence.

Secondly, weight loss and submandibular glands enlargement appeared, leading to the diagnosis of IgG4-RD without a link being able to be established with vascular involvement. This is the second observation of this association. A French translation of the new classification criteria for IgG4-RD published in 2019 by the American College of Rheumatology and European Ligue Against Rhumatism (ACR/EULAR) is offered with direct application to the clinical case.

Methods: Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs) were measured in the peripheral blood of 60 consecutive SSc patients. Serum levels of eight endothelial markers were measured first in these 60 patients, and then in an independent replication cohort of 43 SSc patients in case of association with NVC patterns. NVC patterns were determined by four independent investigators blinded to vascular markers. Results: Patients with the late-NVC pattern exhibited lower EPC levels (P < 0.0001) and higher VEGF levels (P = 0.03). Higher VEGF levels were confirmed to be associated with the late-NVC pattern in the replication cohort (P = 0.01). By multivariate analysis focused on biomarkers, lower EPC (P = 0.03) and higher VEGF levels (P = 0.001) were independently associated with the late-NVC pattern. In an alternate multivariate model including these two factors and SSc-related disease characteristics, lower EPC counts (P = 0.005), higher VEGF levels (P = 0.01), a history of digital ulcers (P = 0.04), and a modified Rodnan skin score > 14 (P < 0.0001) were independently associated with the late-NVC pattern. Conclusion: Our data revealed decreased EPC counts and increased VEGF levels in patients with the late-NVC pattern. Further studies are now needed to determine the role of VEGF and EPCs in endothelial injury and repair in SSc.","[Avouac, Jerome; Allanore, Yannick] Paris Descartes Univ, Rheumatol Dept A, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Cochin Hosp, F-75014 Paris, France; [Avouac, Jerome; Vallucci, Maeva; Ruiz, Barbara; Chiocchia, Gilles; Allanore, Yannick] INSERM, U1016, F-75014 Paris, France; [Avouac, Jerome; Vallucci, Maeva; Ruiz, Barbara; Chiocchia, Gilles; Allanore, Yannick] Paris Descartes Univ, Cochin Inst, CNRS, UMR8104, F-75014 Paris, France; [Smith, Vanessa] Ghent Univ Hosp, Dept Rheumatol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Senet, Patricia; Frances, Camille] Univ Paris 10, Tenon Hosp, Dept Dermatol, F-75020 Paris, France; [Sulli, Alberto; Pizzorni, Carmen; Cutolo, Maurizio] Univ Genoa, Dept Internal Med, Res Lab, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Sulli, Alberto; Pizzorni, Carmen; Cutolo, Maurizio] Univ Genoa, Dept Internal Med, Acad Unit Clin Rheumatol, I-16132 Genoa, Italy",,"Allanore, Y (通讯作者)，Paris Descartes Univ, Rheumatol Dept A, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Cochin Hosp, Rue Faubourg St Jacques 27, F-75014 Paris, France.",yannick.allanore@cch.aphp.fr,"Sulli, Alberto/AAD-1257-2022; avouac, Jérôme/AAD-2101-2020","Avouac, Jerome/0000-0002-2463-218X; VALLUCCI, Maeva/0000-0002-9645-0553",Actelion Pharmaceuticals France,Actelion Pharmaceuticals France,This research work was supported by an unrestricted grant from Actelion Pharmaceuticals France.,,42,50,53,0,4,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1478-6354,1478-6362,,ARTHRITIS RES THER,Arthritis Res.

We report a case of a primary cutaneous CD30+ T-cell lymphoproliferation occurring 6 months after initiation of fingolimod. Based on a systematic literature review, the characteristics of these fingolimod-induced lymphoproliferative disorders are described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: - A 56-year-old woman developed cutaneous indurated and ulcerated nodular lesions 6 months after starting fingolimod for active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Histological examination of a punch biopsy sample demonstrated a polymorphous dermal infiltrate containing large atypical CD30+ cells, leading to diagnosis of primary cutaneous CD30+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Chest-abdomen-pelvis CT scans were performed to rule out secondary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Spontaneous clinical regression was observed and after assessing the benefit/risk ratio, it was decided to continue fingolimod under strict surveillance, with no relapse occurring by month 18. DISCUSSION: - A systematic review of PUBMED/Medline and Embase identified seven other cases of lymphoproliferative disorders occurring during fingolimod treatment, including two other cases of primitive cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders. CONCLUSION: - Even if cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders occur only rarely during fingolimod treatment, dermatologists should nevertheless be aware of this association for which strict dermatological surveillance is required. We would also stress that these CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders can disappear spontaneously, as in our case, even if treatment by fingolimod is continued. Copyright (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

While molecular-dynamics (MD) calculations have been used to model conductance through atomic vacancies, corresponding experiments are lacking. We create sub-nanometer vacancies in suspended single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) via Ga+ ion irradiation, producing membranes containing similar to 300 to 1200 pores with average and maximum diameters of similar to 0.5 and similar to 1 nm, respectively. Vacancies exhibit missing Mo and S atoms, as shown by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM). The longitudinal acoustic band and defect-related photoluminescence were observed in Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, respectively. As the irradiation dose is increased, the median vacancy area remains roughly constant, while the number of vacancies (pores) increases. Ionic current versus voltage is nonlinear and conductance is comparable to that of 1 nm diameter single MoS2 pores, proving that the smaller pores in the distribution display negligible conductance. Consistently, MD simulations show that pores with diameters <0.6 nm are almost impermeable to ionic flow. Atomic pore structure and geometry, studied by AC-STEM, are critical in the sub-nanometer regime in which the pores are not circular and the diameter is not well-defined. This study lays the foundation for future experiments to probe transport in large distributions of angstrom-size pores.","[Thiruraman, Jothi Priyanka; Danda, Goinath; Das, Paul Masih; Drndic, Marija] Univ Penn, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Thiruraman, Jothi Priyanka; Danda, Goinath] Univ Penn, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Fujisawa, Kazunori; Bolotsky, Adam; Perea-Lopez, Nestor; Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, Ctr Dimens & Layered Mat 2, 104 Davey Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Dept Chem, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zhang, Tianyi; Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Nicolai, Adrien; Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, UMR 6303, 9 Ave Alain Savary,BP 47870, F-21078 Dijon, France",,"Drndic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",drndic@physics.upenn.edu,"Zhang, Tianyi/E-1960-2016; Perea-Lopez, Nestor/A-2683-2010; Thiruraman, Jothi Priyanka/AAO-6679-2021; NICOLAÏ, Adrien/P-9026-2019; Danda, Gopinath/J-7771-2019; Terrones, Mauricio/B-3829-2014; Fujisawa, Kazunori/M-5934-2018","Zhang, Tianyi/0000-0002-8998-3837; Perea-Lopez, Nestor/0000-0002-3197-759X; Terrones, Mauricio/0000-0003-0010-2851; Fujisawa, Kazunori/0000-0002-3827-6921; Bolotsky, Adam/0000-0002-4716-012X; Thiruraman, Jothi Priyanka/0000-0001-5089-491X; Danda, Gopinath/0000-0003-3455-3474; Masih Das, Paul/0000-0003-2644-2280","NIH [R21HG007856, R01HG006879]; NSF [EFRI 2-DARE (EFRI-1542707)]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), Directorate for Engineering of the National Science Foundation (NSF), Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Office [FA9550-17-1-0047]","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), Directorate for Engineering of the National Science Foundation (NSF), Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Office","This work was funded by NIH grant nos.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) encompasses diseases with distinct pathological mechanisms, such as HUS due to shiga-like toxin-producing bacteria (STEC-HUS) and atypical HUS, linked to defects in the alternate complement pathway. Other etiologies such as Parvovirus B19 infection are exceptional. All these causes are rare to such extent that we usually consider them mutually exclusive. We report here two cases of HUS that could be traced to multiple causes. Cases presentation: Case 1 presented as vomiting and diarrhea. All biological characteristics of HUS were present. STEC was found in stool (by PCR and culture). After initial remission, a recurrence occurred and patient was started on Eculizumab. Genetic analysis revealed the heterozygous presence of a CFHR1/CFH hybrid gene. The issue was favorable under treatment.In case 2, HUS presented as fever, vomiting and purpura of the lower limbs. Skin lesions and erythroblastopenia led to suspect Parvovirus B19 primo-infection, which was confirmed by peripheral blood and medullar PCR. Concurrently, stool culture and PCR revealed the presence of STEC. Evolution showed spontaneous recovery. Conclusions: Both cases defy Ockham's razor in the sense that multiple causes could be traced to a single outcome; furthermore, they invite us to reflect on the physiopathology of HUS as they question the classical distinction between STEC-HUS and atypical HUS. We propose a two-hit mechanism model leading to HUS. Indeed, in case 1, HUS unfolded as a result of the synergistic interaction between an infectious trigger and a genetic predisposition. In case 2 however, it is the simultaneous occurrence of two infectious triggers that led to HUS. In dissent from Ockham's razor, an exceptional disease such as HUS may stem from the sequential occurrence or co-occurrence of several rare conditions.","[Schwarz, Chloe; Mousseaux, Cyril; Luque, Yosu; Mohamadou, Inna; Rondeau, Eric; Rafat, Cedric] Hop Tenon, Serv Urgences Nephrol & Transplantat Renale, Paris, France; [Brehon, Alice; Senet, Patricia] Hop Tenon, Serv Dermatol, Paris, France; [Mariani, Patricia] Hop Robert Debre, Microbiol Serv, Paris, France; [Zafrani, Lara] Hop St Louis, Serv Med Intens & Reanimat, Paris, France; [Fremeaux-Bacchi, Veronique] Hop Europeen Georges Pompidou, Serv Immunol, Paris, France; [Buob, David] Hop Tenon, Serv Anatomopathol, Paris, France",,"Schwarz, C (通讯作者)，Hop Tenon, Serv Urgences Nephrol & Transplantat Renale, Paris, France.",chloe.schwarz@gmail.com,"Luque, Yosu/AAE-8565-2021","Luque, Yosu/0000-0002-3172-6571",,,,,18,0,0,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2369,,BMC NEPHROL,BMC Nephrol.,JUL 11,2020.0,21,1,,,,,,,269,10.1186/s12882-020-01926-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12882-020-01926-2,,,5,Urology & Nephrology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Urology & Nephrology,MP2LM,32652955.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000552040700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological characteristics and to identify prognostic factors for healing in a prospective cohort of 59 patients presenting HLU. Patients and methods. - The cohort comprised patients included in a randomized, double-blind, controlled study published elsewhere; the patients were receiving becaplermin gel (Regranex(R)) or Duoderm Hydrogel(TM) once daily for eight weeks for the most recent wound. Total follow-up was 12 weeks. Results. - The epidemiological analysis was performed for 59 consecutive patients randomized in 17 dermatology departments. Mean patient age was 74.5 +/- 9 years and 61% were female. Mean wound duration was 11.1 +/- 9 weeks and median wound area was 16 cm(2) (q1; q3: 8; 25.5). Among, 94.9% of patients had hypertension and 39.7% were diabetic. A homolateral peripheral pulse was present in 91.5% of patients. At the end of follow-up, complete wound healing was obtained in 30.5% of the patients. In univariate analysis, neither the foregoing criteria nor the treatment group were significantly associated with healing during the study. Conclusion. - This study confirms female predominance, old age, prevalence of diabetes and delay in the diagnosis of HLU. The prognosis for healing does not appear to be dependent on wound duration, wound area or the presence of moderate peripheral arterial disease, doubtless because this condition progresses by episodes of flare-up and under specific conditions.

In vitro coculture experiments of sorted cTfh and B cells were performed for functional analysis. IgG and IgM production were measured by ELISA. Results We observed that cTfh cell numbers are increased in patients with SSc compared with HC. Furthermore, the increase in cTfh cells was more potent in patients with severe forms of SSc such as diffuse SSc and in the presence of arterial pulmonary hypertension. cTfh cells from patients with SSc present an activated Tfh phenotype, with high expression of BCL-6, increased capacity to produce IL-21 in comparison with healthy controls. In vitro, cTfh cells from patients with SSc had higher capacity to stimulate the differentiation of CD19(+)CD27(+)CD38(hi) B cells and their secretion of IgG and IgM through the IL-21 pathway than Tfh cells from healthy controls. Blocking IL-21R or using the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib reduced the Tfh cells' capacity to stimulate the plasmablasts and decreased the Ig production. Conclusions Circulating Tfh cells are increased in SSc and correlate with SSc severity. The IL-21 pathway or JAK1/2 blockade by ruxolitinib could be a promising strategy in the treatment of SSc.","[Ricard, Laure; Jachiet, Vincent; Malard, Florent; Ye, Yishan; Stocker, Nicolas; Mohty, Mohamad; Gaugler, Beatrice; Mekinian, Arsene] Sorbonne Univ, CRSA, INSERM, U938, Paris, France; [Ricard, Laure; Jachiet, Vincent; Riviere, Sebastien; Fain, Olivier; Mekinian, Arsene] Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Serv Med Interne & Inflammat DHU I2B, Paris, France; [Malard, Florent; Mohty, Mohamad; Gaugler, Beatrice] Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Serv Hematol Clin & Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France; [Senet, Patricia; Monfort, Jean-Benoit] Hop Tenon, AP HP, Serv Dermatol, Paris, France",,"Mekinian, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris, Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Serv Med Interne & Inflammat DHU I2B, F-75012 Paris, France.",arsene.mekinian@aphp.fr,"Gaugler-Verjus, Beatrice/M-3528-2018","Gaugler-Verjus, Beatrice/0000-0001-9434-7176; Stocker, Nicolas/0000-0001-7316-5832",Aterhit Foundation; 'Groupe Francophone de Recherche sur la Sclerodermie' (GFRS),Aterhit Foundation; 'Groupe Francophone de Recherche sur la Sclerodermie' (GFRS),This work was supported by the Aterhit Foundation and received grants from 'Groupe Francophone de Recherche sur la Sclerodermie' (GFRS).,,55,38,40,1,17,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",0003-4967,1468-2060,,ANN RHEUM DIS,Ann.

In mice, we have demonstrated that, depending on the model, IL-17 may act as a tumor growth-promoting or -inhibiting factor. In order to address the relevance of these models in human tumors, we look for the natural expression and activity of IL-17 in mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sezary syndrome (SS). These cutaneous T-cell lymphomas were selected because they are usually CD3+ CD4+ CD45RO(+), a phenotype similar to nontransformed T cells producing IL-17. We show that in vitro activated malignant T cells derived from MF or SS patients express IL-17 mRNA and secrete this cytokine. However, IL-17 does not act in vitro as a growth factor for MF or SS cell lines. In addition, 5 out of 10 MF/SS biopsies expressed IL-17 mRNA, while this cytokine was not detected in normal skin. IL-17 was not observed in the biopsies derived from 2 patients initially identified as MF, whereas an upregulation of this cytokine was clearly demonstrated during progression of the disease in these patients. An association between IL-17 expression and polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration was also recorded in this group of MF/SS patients. A more detailed analysis of 2 patients with a pustular form of MF and SS revealed that IL-17 may participate in the recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils via a paracrine mechanism involving keratinocyte-released IL-8. This study is the first report demonstrating that some human tumor cells could express IL-17, a cytokine that represents an early event in the development of the inflammatory reaction within the tumor microenvironment, a process that may influence tumor phenotype and growth.

Different from atrophie blanche (AB), which is a clinical manifestation of certain scars, LV may have AB in combination with recurrent livedo reticularis with chronic and painful skin ulcers particularly around the ankle region, and at the back of the feet. Histology is characterized by segmental hyalinizing changes at the subintimal region of small dermal vessels with thrombotic occlusions. LV skin ulcers resolve with stellate, porcelain-white scars that need to be distinguished from similar changes seen with venous insufficiency. Atrophie blanche was originally used synonymously with livedoid vasculopathy. AB describes spontaneously occurring porcelain-white skin areas with red dots that typically occur in the context of skin changes attributed to chronic venous insufficiency. The 2 forms of AB-(1) the LV-AB complex and (2) AB in the context of chronic venous insufficiency-are unrelated and require separate diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Using a modified Delphi method, we have developed an international consensus document on the diagnosis and management of LV.

GSTs have been proposed to play a dual role in the signal termination of insect chemodetection by modifying odorant and tasting molecules and by protecting the chemosensory system. Among the 40 GSTs identified in Drosophila melanogaster, the Delta and Epsilon groups are insect-specific. GSTs Delta and Epsilon may have evolved to serve in detoxification, and have been associated with insecticide resistance. Here, we report the heterologous expression and purification of the D. melanogaster GST Delta 2 (GSTD2). We investigated the capacity of GSTD2 to bind tasting molecules. Among them, we found that isothiocyanates (ITC), insecticidal compounds naturally present in cruciferous plant and perceived as bitter, are good substrates for GSTD2. The X-ray structure of GSTD2 was solved, showing the absence of the classical Ser catalytic residue, conserved in the Delta and Epsilon GSTs. Using molecular dynamics, the interaction of ITC with the GSTD2 three-dimensional structure is analysed and discussed. These findings allow us to consider a biological role for GSTD2 in chemoperception, considering GSTD2 expression in the chemosensory organs and the potential consequences of insect exposure to ITC.","[Gonzalez, Daniel; Fraichard, Stephane; Chavanne, Evelyne; Mucher, Elodie; Artur, Yves; Ferveur, Jean-Francois; Heydel, Jean-Marie; Briand, Loic; Neiers, Fabrice] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, INRA, CSGA, Dijon, France; [Grassein, Paul; Delarue, Patrice; Senet, Patrick; Nicolai, Adrien] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, 9 Av Savary,BP 47 870, F-21078 Dijon, France",,"Neiers, F (通讯作者)，CSGA, 17 Rue Sully, F-21065 Dijon, France.",fabrice.neiers@u-bourgogne.fr,"NICOLAÏ, Adrien/P-9026-2019; ARTUR, Yves E/A-8504-2019; Neiers, Fabrice/AAM-1637-2021; Fraichard, Stephane/R-1930-2019","Neiers, Fabrice/0000-0002-8965-4929; Mucher, Elodie/0000-0003-3189-5647; Heydel, jean-Marie/0000-0002-6089-9922",Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-16-CE21-0004-01],Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR), located at 50 avenue Daumesnil, Paris (75012), grant number ANR-16-CE21-0004-01.",,80,30,32,1,27,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-1748,1879-0240,,INSECT BIOCHEM MOLEC,Insect Biochem.

All three types entail alterations of salt concentrations leading to impaired biochemical processes, and can finally cause severe morbidity. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the feasibility of a microwave-based sensor technology for the non-invasive measurement of the hydration status. Electromagnetic waves at high frequencies interact with molecules, especially water. Hence, if a sample contains free water molecules, this can be detected in a reflected microwave signal. To develop the sensor system, human three-dimensional skin equivalents were instituted as a standardized test platform mimicking reproducible exsiccosis scenarios. Therefore, skin equivalents with a specific hydration and density of matrix components were generated and microwave measurements were performed. Hydration-specific spectra allowed deriving the hydration state of the skin models. A further advantage of the skin equivalents was the characterization of the impact of distinct skin components on the measured signals to investigate mechanisms of signal generation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a non-invasive microwave-based hydration sensor technology. The sensor bears potential to be integrated in a wearable medical device for personal health monitoring.","[Brendtke, Rico; Walles, Heike; Hansmann, Jan] Univ Hosp Wuerzburg, Chair Tissue Engn & Regenerat Med TERM, Roentgenring 11, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Brendtke, Rico; Wiehl, Michael] Senet Healthcare Grp GmbH & Co KG, Henkestr 91, D-91052 Erlangen, Germany; [Groeber, Florian; Schwarz, Thomas; Walles, Heike; Hansmann, Jan] Fraunhofer Inst Interfacial Engn & Biotechnol IGB, Translat Ctr Oncol Wuerzburg Regenerat Therapies, Roentgenring 11, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany",,"Hansmann, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Wuerzburg, Chair Tissue Engn & Regenerat Med TERM, Roentgenring 11, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.;Hansmann, J (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer Inst Interfacial Engn & Biotechnol IGB, Translat Ctr Oncol Wuerzburg Regenerat Therapies, Roentgenring 11, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",Jan.Hansmann@uni-wuerzburg.de,,"Walles, Heike/0000-0002-1512-7448",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [16SV6259]; GmbH Co.,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); GmbH Co.,"This project was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, funding number: 16SV6259). senetics healthcare group GmbH & Co.

To date, no prenatal cases have been reported. Here, we report on the first prenatal case of Juberg-Hayward syndrome. The diagnosis was established following fetopathological study. Besides the cardinal features of the syndrome, this prenatal case was remarkable for the severity of the short arm malformation and by the finding of big toe agenesis and cerebral abnormalities including hydrocephalus, agenesis of corpus callosum, and cerebellar hypoplasia.

For a molecule, its beta is decomposed into local and nonlocal contributions of individual atoms or groups. The former describes the response within the atomic sphere, while the latter describes the contributions from interatomic charge transfer. This scheme is then applied to six prototypical donor-acceptor (D-A) or D-pi-A molecules for which the local and nonlocal hyperpolarizabilities are evaluated based on their MP2 density. Both the local and nonlocal parts exhibit site-specific characteristics, but vary differently with molecular structures. The local part depends mainly on the atomic attributes such as electronegativity and charge state, as well as its location in themolecule, while the nonlocal part relates to the ability and distance of charge delocalization within the molecule, increasing rapidly with molecular size. The proposed decomposition scheme provides a way to distinguish atomic or group contributions to molecular hyperpolarizabilities, which is useful in the molecular design for organic nonlinear optical materials.

Depending on the MgO thickness, which has been varied from 1.5 to 4 monolayers, two opposite temperature dependences are clearly disentangled. For a thin MgO spacer, the main component decreases with temperature following a metalliclike behavior. On the contrary, for the thickestMgO layers, the main component increases with temperature, following an Arrhenius law. Moreover, the insertion of a monoatomic roughness at the bottom MgO interface, induced by the addition of a fraction of a Fe monolayer, exacerbates the metallic features as an oscillatory behavior from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic is observed. These results allow questioning the simple tunneling mechanism usually invoked for MgO coupling, and suggest a crossover behavior of the thin MgO spacer from metallic to insulating with a progressive opening of the gap.","[Bellouard, C.; Duluard, A.; Lu, Y.; Lacour, D.; Senet, C.; Robert, S.; Andrieu, S.; Hehn, M.] Univ Lorraine, Inst Jean Lamour, UMR 7198, CNRS, Boite Postale 230, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Snoeck, E.] CEMES CNRS, 29 Rue Jeanne Marvig, F-31055 Toulouse, France; [Negulescu, B.] Univ Tours, UFR Sci & Tech, Grp Rech Mat Microelect Acoust & Nanotechnol, Parc Grandmont,Batiment E, F-37200 Tours, France; [Maloufi, N.] Univ Lorraine, Lab Etude Microstruct & Mecan Mat LEM3, UMR 7239, F-57045 Metz 1, France; [Tiusan, C.] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Ctr Superconduct Spintron & Surface Sci, Str Memorandumului 28, RO-400114 Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Tiusan, C.] DGDR, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, DR06, Paris, France",,"Bellouard, C (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, Inst Jean Lamour, UMR 7198, CNRS, Boite Postale 230, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.",christine.bellouard@univ-lorraine.fr,"Tiusan, Coriolan V./F-1564-2011; andrieu, stephane/N-3654-2016; Tiusan, Coriolan Viorel/ABB-4399-2021; Lu, Yuan/M-9239-2014; Lacour, Daniel/J-2630-2015","Tiusan, Coriolan V./0000-0003-1338-3867; andrieu, stephane/0000-0003-0373-8193; Tiusan, Coriolan Viorel/0000-0003-1338-3867; Lu, Yuan/0000-0003-3337-8205; Negulescu, Beatrice/0000-0001-7218-9859; Lacour, Daniel/0000-0002-5871-8870","french PIA project Lorraine Universite d'Excellence, [ANR-15-IDEX-04-LUE]","french PIA project Lorraine Universite d'Excellence,","C.B. is thankful to Jerome Eugene for his help and collaboration.

The main objective is the development of clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of health care and outcomes for cancer patients. The methodology is based on literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary experts group, with feedback from specialists in cancer care patients. Objective: To develop a clinical practice guideline for the management of neutropenic cancer patients (excluding prolonged neutropenia). Methods: Data have been identified by literature search using Medline and Current Contents (up to February 1997) and personal reference lists. The main end points considered were mortality, morbidity, risk factors fever, source of infection, microbiological documentation, incidence and length of hospital stays, quality of life, efficacy of treatment, safety and costs. Once the guideline was defined, the document was submitted to 48 reviewers for peer review and to the medical committees of the 20 French Cancer Centres for review and agreement Results: The key recommendations are: 1) before receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, patients most be informed of potential risks and precautions to observe; 2) non-febrile neutropenic patients can be followed at home (except specific context); antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended 3) initial empirical antibiotic therapy for febrile patients is mandatory, whether associated beta-lactam and aminoglycoside, or monotherapy with a broad-spectrum beta-lactam (except in care of septic shock or pneumopathy). A glycopeptide can be added in care of overt catheter-related or cutaneous infection, in care of microbiologically documented infection with a oxacillin-resistant Cram positive bacteria, or in case of persistent fever in a clinically deteriorating patient; 4) at the present time, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the management of febrile neutropenic patients at home. We recommend participation in studies to identify predicting factors of low-risk patients and to assess the feasibility and safety of early discharge and home therapy.","SOR, FNCLCC, Operat Stand Opt Recommandat, F-75654 Paris 13, France; Ctr Leon Berard, F-69373 Lyon, France; Inst Curie, Paris, France; Inst Jules Bordet, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; Ctr Oscar Lambret, F-59020 Lille, France; Inst Jean Godinoi, F-51056 Reims, France; Ctr Eugene Marquis, Rennes, France; Ctr Paul Strauss, Strasbourg, France; Ctr Rene Huguenin, St Cloud, France; Ctr Paul Papin, Angers, France; Ctr Antoine Lacassagne, F-06054 Nice, France",,"Biron, P (通讯作者)，SOR, FNCLCC, Operat Stand Opt Recommandat, 101 Rue Tolbiac, F-75654 Paris 13, France.",,,,,,,,101,6,6,0,2,JOHN LIBBEY EUROTEXT LTD,ARCUEIL,"30, RUE BERTHOLLET, BATIMENT A, 94110 ARCUEIL, FRANCE",0007-4551,1769-6917,,B CANCER,Bull.

The aim of this work was to study inter-and intra-observer agreement for the diagnosis of scleroderma pattern by wide-field capillaroscopy. Methods. Images were taken from 50 patients known to have SSc and 50 controls consulting for RP who did not have SSc. These images were rated simultaneously by 11 experienced vascular medicine physicians as scleroderma pattern or not. Two weeks later, 7 of the 11 observers again rated the same images. Results. Inter-observer agreement was almost perfect between the 11 observers (k 0.86 +/- 0.01), and the proportion of concordant observations was 79% (70-87). When each observer was compared with the reference, agreement was also almost perfect: k coefficient 0.92 +/- 0.03 and proportion of concordant observations 79% (70-87). Intra-observer agreement was also almost perfect: median k coefficient 0.94 (0.78 +/- 0.96) and median proportion of concordant observations 97% (89-98). Conclusion. Excellent inter-and intra-observer agreement was obtained in experienced vascular physicians for the diagnosis of capillaroscopic landscape by wide-field nailfold capillary microscopy.","[Boulon, Carine; Mangin, Marion; Constans, Joel] Hop St Andre, Serv Med Vasc, Bordeaux, France; [Blaise, Sophie; Imbert, Bernard; Carpentier, Patrick] CHU Grenoble Alpes, Serv Med Vasc, La Tronche, France; [Lazareth, Isabelle] Hop St Joseph, Serv Med Vasc, Paris, France; [Le Hello, Claire] CHU St Etienne, Hop Nord, Serv Med Vasc, St Etienne, France; [Pistorius, Marc-Antoine] Hop Hotel Dieu, Serv Med Vasc, Nantes, France; [Sintes, Pierre] Med Vasc, St Cloud, France; [Senet, Patricia; Tribout, Laurent] Hop Tenon, Serv Dermatol Med Vasc & Allergol, Paris, France; [Decamps-Le Chevoir, Joelle] Hop Pitie, Serv Med Interne, Paris, France",,"Constans, J (通讯作者)，CHU Bordeaux, Serv Med Vasc & Med Interne, Hop St Andre, F-33075 Bordeaux, France.",joel.constans@chu-bordeaux.fr,"Blaise, Sophie/AAD-4476-2019; Blaise, Sophie/AAS-2389-2020","Blaise, Sophie/0000-0001-7238-112X; Blaise, Sophie/0000-0001-7238-112X",Societe Francaise de Medecine Vasculaire; Societe Francaise de Microcirculation,Societe Francaise de Medecine Vasculaire; Societe Francaise de Microcirculation,This study was supported by the Societe Francaise de Medecine Vasculaire and the Societe Francaise de Microcirculation.,,16,12,12,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1462-0324,1462-0332,,RHEUMATOLOGY,RHEUMATOLOGY,OCT,2017.0,56,10,,,,,1780,1783,,10.1093/rheumatology/kex282,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/kex282,,,4,Rheumatology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Rheumatology,FH9GG,28957564.0,Bronze,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000411518400025,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, since the 1950s, various studies have shown translational activity within spermatozoa, particularly during their in vitro capacitation. But the type of ribosomes involved (cytoplasmic or mitochondrial) is still debated. Here, we investigate the presence and activity of the two types of ribosomes in mature human spermatozoa. By targeting ribosomal RNAs and proteins, we show that both types of ribosomes are localized in the midpiece as well as in the neck and the base of the head of the spermatozoa. We assessed the impact of cycloheximide (CHX) and chloramphenicol (CP), inhibitors of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomes, respectively, on different sperm parameters. Neither CHX, nor CP impacted sperm vitality, mitochondrial activity (measured through the ATP content), or capacitation (measured through the content in phosphotyrosines). However, increasing CP concentrations induced a decrease in total and progressive motilities as well as on some kinematic parameters while no effect was observed with CHX. A quantitative proteomic analysis was performed by mass spectrometry in SWATH mode to compare the proteomes of spermatozoa capacitated in the absence or presence of the two ribosome inhibitors. Among the similar to 700 proteins identified in the different tested conditions, 3, 3 and 25 proteins presented a modified abundance in the presence of 1 and 2 mg/ml of CHX, and 1 mg/ml of CP, respectively. The observed abundance variations of some CP-down regulated OPEN proteins were validated using Multiple- Reaction Monitoring (MRM).

The aim of this study was to describe the main causes and outcomes of lower-limb ulcers in systemic sclerosis patients and to assess factors associated with ischaemic causes (arterial disease and/or microvascular impairment). A retrospective, multicentre, case-control study was conducted in 2013 and 2014, including 45 systemic sclerosis patients presenting lower-limb ulcers between 2008 and 2013. The estimated prevalence of lower-limb ulcers among systemic sclerosis patients was 12.8%. Ulcers were related to venous insufficiency in 22 cases (49%), ischaemic causes in 21 (47%) and other causes in 2 (4%). Complete healing was observed in 60% of cases in a mean time of 10.3 months; 59% relapsed during a mean followup of 22 months. Ischaemic lower-limb ulcer outcomes were poor, with a 28.6% amputation rate. Logistic-regression multivariate analyses between ischaemic lower-limb ulcer cases and matched systemic sclerosis-controls identified past or concomitant digital ulcer and cutaneous sclerosis of the feet as independent risk factors associated with ischaemic lower-limb ulcers.","[Bohelay, Gerome; Baudot, Nathalie; Senet, Patricia] Tenon Hosp, Publ Assistance Paris Hosp AP HP, Dept Dermatol, Paris, France; [Blaise, Sophie] Grenoble Univ Hosp, Vasc Med Dept, Grenoble, France; [Levy, Pierre] Pierre & Marie Curie Univ, Tenon Hosp, AP HP, Dept Publ Hlth, Paris, France; [Levy, Pierre] French Natl Inst Hlth & Med Res, UMR S 1136, Paris, France; [Claeys, Antoine] Grenoble Univ Hosp Ctr, Nord Hosp, Dept Dermatol & Photobiol, Grenoble, France; [Cuny, Jean-Francois; Granel-Brocard, Florence] Nancy Univ Hosp Ctr, Brabois Hosp, Nancy, France; [Maillard, Herve; Beneton, Nathalie] Le Mans Hosp, Le Mans, France; [Boye, Thierry] St Anne Mil Hosp, Toulon, France; [Lok, Catherine] Amiens Univ Hosp, Amiens, France; [Frances, Camille] Tenon Hosp, AP HP, Paris, France; [Frances, Camille] Pierre & Marie Curie Univ, Paris, France",,"Senet, P (通讯作者)，Tenon Hosp, AP HP, Dept Dermatol, 4 Rue Chine, FR-75020 Paris, France.",patricia.senet@aphp.fr,"Blaise, Sophie/AAD-4476-2019; Bohelay, Gérôme/AHD-8926-2022; Blaise, Sophie/AAS-2389-2020","Blaise, Sophie/0000-0001-7238-112X; Blaise, Sophie/0000-0001-7238-112X; BOHELAY, Gerome/0000-0002-8792-979X; Levy, Pierre/0000-0002-2485-3628",,,,,38,8,8,1,4,ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA,UPPSALA,"TRADGARDSGATAN 14, UPPSALA, SE-753 09, SWEDEN",0001-5555,1651-2057,,ACTA DERM-VENEREOL,Acta Derm.-Venereol.,JUL,2018.0,98,7,,,,,677,682,,10.2340/00015555-2939,http://dx.doi.org/10.2340/00015555-2939,,,6,Dermatology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Dermatology,GL6CV,29648670.0,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000437266600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this model, there is always the uncertainty of whether the user will be able to establish the desired lightpath at the desired time or not. Furthermore, in the context of a number of applications, e.g., Grid applications, users need to setup lightpaths in advance to perform their activities that are planned in advance. In this paper, we propose a scheme that allows the setup of inter-domain lightpaths in advance; it extends the Optical Routing Border Gateway Protocol (ORBGP) to get information about inter-domain paths and availability of wavelengths over a certain period of time in the future.

In addition, HIQM does not rely on the availability of the full reference of the original image at the receiver.","Blekinge Inst Technol, SE-37225 Ronneby, Sweden",,"Kusuma, TM (通讯作者)，Blekinge Inst Technol, SE-37225 Ronneby, Sweden.",maulana.kusuma@bth.se; hans-jurgen.zepernick@bth.se; caldera@watri.org.au,"Kusuma, Tubagus M/D-7074-2015; Kusuma, Tubagus Maulana/M-6919-2019; Zepernick, Hans-Jürgen/AFJ-2429-2022; Zepernick, Hans-Jürgen/AAF-4549-2022","Kusuma, Tubagus M/0000-0002-0138-5315; Kusuma, Tubagus Maulana/0000-0002-0138-5315; Zepernick, Hans-Jurgen/0000-0003-3604-2766",,,,,9,23,23,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,0-7695-2422-2,,,,2005.0,,,,,,,178,184,,10.1109/ICW.2005.60,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICW.2005.60,,,7,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BDB90,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000232429900030,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper we describe the design of the server, of its control protocol and of its functionalities such as file playing, DTMF detection, RTP proxying and audio recording. For file playing, we propose an approach to schedule RTP packet transmission that overcomes the irregularity of event scheduling of the operating system and for conversation recording, we propose an original approach to synchronize media streams that allows to avoid voice overlap while recording a conversation. We have conducted many experiments on the Media Server We evaluated the accuracy of the file playing timing under different load conditions, the effect of the RTP proxying on the media quality and the subjective quality of recorded conversations. The results of these experiments show the great impact of the load of the Media Server on the performance of its functionalities, the improvement that the packet scheduling algorithm brings to the precision of interdeparture timing, and the good subjective quality of the recorded conversation using our synchronizing approach.","Univ Quebec, EMT, INRS, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",,"Khlifi, H (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, EMT, INRS, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",,,,,,,,4,1,2,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,0-7695-2422-2,,,,2005.0,,,,,,,147,152,,10.1109/ICW.2005.40,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICW.2005.40,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BDB90,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000232429900025,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper unequal error protection (UEP) is proposed for ROI coded JPEG2000 images as a technique for providing increased resilience against the effects of transmission errors over a wireless communications channel. The hierarchical nature of an ROI coded JPEG2000 code-stream lends itself to the use of UEP whereby the important bits of the code-stream are protected with a strong code while the less important bits are protected with a weaker code. Simulation results obtained using symbol-by-symbol maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoding demonstrate that the use of UEP offers significant gains in terms of the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and the percentage of readable files. Moreover, the use of ROI-based UEP leads to reduced computational complexity at the receiver.","Western Australian Telecommun Res Inst, Nedlands, WA 6907, Australia",,"Yatawara, Y (通讯作者)，Western Australian Telecommun Res Inst, 39 Fairway, Nedlands, WA 6907, Australia.",,"Zepernick, Hans-Jürgen/AAF-4549-2022; Kusuma, Tubagus M/D-7074-2015; Kusuma, Tubagus Maulana/M-6919-2019; Zepernick, Hans-Jürgen/AFJ-2429-2022","Kusuma, Tubagus M/0000-0002-0138-5315; Kusuma, Tubagus Maulana/0000-0002-0138-5315; Zepernick, Hans-Jurgen/0000-0003-3604-2766",,,,,9,6,6,0,6,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,0-7695-2422-2,,,,2005.0,,,,,,,111,115,,10.1109/ICW.2005.79,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICW.2005.79,,,5,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BDB90,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000232429900019,View Full Record in Web of Science

We focus our study on the effectiveness of the various QoS mechanisms for supporting time-constrained services.","Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Comp Engn, Albacete, Spain",,"Villalon, J (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Comp Engn, Albacete, Spain.",,"Cuenca, Pedro/P-7960-2019; Orozco, Luis Barbosa/AAV-3788-2020; Micó-Enguídanos, Francisco/GNW-3920-2022; Cuenca, Pedro/L-1593-2014","Cuenca, Pedro/0000-0002-2791-0165; Micó-Enguídanos, Francisco/0000-0001-5442-9396; Cuenca, Pedro/0000-0002-2791-0165; Orozco-Barbosa, Luis/0000-0003-1510-1608; Villalon Millan, Jose Miguel/0000-0002-8546-7130",,,,,8,1,1,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,0-7695-2422-2,,,,2005.0,,,,,,,135,140,,10.1109/ICW.2005.71,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICW.2005.71,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BDB90,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000232429900023,View Full Record in Web of Science

When an accident occurs in a road or highway, alarm messages must be disseminated, instead of ad-hoc routed, to inform all other vehicles. To position a broken vehicle (or vehicle in danger) and locate the vehicles in its vicinity is very important for the safety of the road users. However, vehicles are not necessary equipped with GPS and even they cannot obtain availability of line of sight access to satellites, particularly when they enter tunnels. In this paper, we propose an improvement to ODAM Optimized disseminating alarm messages protocol in order to support localization of GPS-unequipped vehicles. So, the number of vehicles discovering their localisation will be increased. This prevents pile-up of cars when fogs, accident or any other obstacle and then contributes to the driver safety.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an inflammatory cutaneous disease. Those diseases can occur simultaneously among the same individual. Our objective was to describe the features of patients displaying both FMF and HS. Methods: We screened the French adult FMF reference center for FMF patients with HS. Results: Six patients out of 151 (4%) with a median age of 36 years old were concerned. Among them, FMF was symptomatic at a median age of 11.5 years old and colchicine was introduced at a median age of 20.5 years old. HS was diagnosed at a median age of 31.5 years old. An elderly patient displayed AA amyloidosis in the outcome of FMF, with a late diagnosis of HS, with response to anakinra. There was no temporal relation between FMF and HS attacks. Some patients had a persistent inflammatory syndrome under treatment. Conclusion: FMF and HS are both inflammatory diseases involving young patients, with HS possibly being an autoinflammatory disease. Although their association seems to be fortuitous, both can induce an important inflammation state that could lead to AA amyloidosis and require a close monitoring of clinical signs and acute-phase reactants. Anakinra was successful in treating the only patient with both HS, FMF and amyloidosis. (C) 2016 Societe francaise de rhumatologie. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to predict the frame size for each transmission, which enhances the energy efficiency of the system and minimizes latencies.

Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulations to generate optimal solutions for this problem are computationally intractable, even for moderate sized networks. A standard approach is to decouple the problem of logical topology design and the problem of routing on this logical topology. Heuristics for finding the logical topology exist and a straightforward linear program (LP), based on the node-arc formulation is normally used to solve the routing problem over a given logical topology. Such LP formulations become computationally infeasible for large networks. In this paper, we present a new formulation for optimally routing traffic over a given logical topology. Our formulation is based on the arc-chain representation and minimizes the congestion of the network. We have used an implicit column generation technique and exploited the special Generalized Upper Bounding structure of our formulation to efficiently solve the problem.","Univ Windsor, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada",,"Aneja, YP (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,0-7695-2422-2,,,,2005.0,,,,,,,268,274,,10.1109/ICW.2005.23,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICW.2005.23,,,7,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BDB90,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000232429900044,View Full Record in Web of Science

ObjectivesTo identify which clinical characteristics, among those known as possible prognostic factors of VLU healing, and which VLU-associated sociodemographic and psychological factors, are associated with complete healing at week 24 (W24). MethodsA prospective, multicentre, cohort study was conducted in 22 French dermatology departments between September 2003 and December 2007. The end point was comparison between healed and nonhealed VLUs at W24, for patient clinical and biological characteristics; psychological, cognitive and social assessments; affected leg inclusion characteristics; venous insufficiency treatment and percentage of initial wound area reduction during follow-up. ResultsIn total, 104 VLUs in 104 patients were included; 94 were analysed. The mean VLU area and duration were 36<bold>8555</bold>cm(2) and 24<bold>8457</bold>months, respectively. At W24, 41/94 VLUs were healed. Univariate analysis significantly associated complete healing with superficial venous surgery (P=0<bold>001</bold>), adherence to compression therapy at W4 (P=0<bold>03</bold>) and W24 (P=0<bold>01</bold>), ankle-joint ankylosis (P=0<bold>01</bold>) and mean percentage of VLU area reduction at W4 (P=0<bold>04</bold>).

ConclusionsThese results indicate that complete healing of long-standing, large VLUs is independently associated with ablation of the incompetent superficial vein and percentage of wound area reduction after the first 4weeks of treatment.","[Chaby, G.; Caudron, A.; Thuillier, D.; Lok, C.] Univ Amiens, Hop Sud, Dept Dermatol, F-80054 Amiens, France; [Ganry, O.] Univ Amiens, Hop Nord, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, F-80054 Amiens, France; [Senet, P.] Univ Paris 10, Hop Tenon, AP HP, Dept Dermatol, F-75020 Paris, France; [Debure, C.] Hop Corentin Celton, AP HP, Dept Vasc Rehabil, F-92133 Issy Les Moulineaux, France; [Meaume, S.] Univ Paris 06, Hop Rothschild, AP HP, Dept Dermatol & Gerontol, F-75571 Paris, France; [Truchetet, F.] Hop Bon Secours, Dept Dermatol, F-57038 Metz, France; [Combemale, P.] Ctr Leon Berard, Dept Dermatol, F-69373 Lyon 08, France; [Skowron, F.] Ctr Hosp Valence, Dept Dermatol, F-26953 Valence, France; [Joly, P.] Univ Rouen, Hop Charles Nicolle, Dept Dermatol, F-76038 Rouen, France",,"Chaby, G (通讯作者)，Univ Amiens, Hop Sud, Dept Dermatol, F-80054 Amiens, France.",chaby.guillaume@chu-amiens.fr,"olivier, ganry/AGF-2553-2022",,"French Society of Dermatology; Servier Medical, France","French Society of Dermatology; Servier Medical, France","The study was funded by a grant from the French Society of Dermatology in 2003 and was accorded a research grant from Servier Medical, France, in 2003.",,22,35,35,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0007-0963,1365-2133,,BRIT J DERMATOL,Br.

In this paper, we propose and implement a new stage within the standard prediction-based compression pipeline for the BAPs, termed as BAP sparsing. BAP sparsing compresses a complete block of motion data, consisting of an initial I-frame followed by subsequent P-frames, required for creating the animation. It exploits the inherent hierarchical structure of the human skeletal model to intelligently drop and modify the P-frames, while preserving animation quality. BAP sparsing is shown to result in superior compression of the BAP data, with negligible loss in the motion animation quality. It is also shown to result in a lower network throughput requirement and fewer CPU cycles on the client end to create the animation. The proposed method is particularly well suited for animation using BAP data.","Univ Georgia, Dept Comp Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,"Chattopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Comp Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",siddh@cs.uga.edu; suchi@cs.uga.edu; kangli@cs.uga.edu,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,0-7695-2422-2,,,,2005.0,,,,,,,104,109,,10.1109/ICW.2005.32,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICW.2005.32,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BDB90,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000232429900018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The dynamics of peer participation (churn) is an inherent property of P2P systems that should be incorporated in the design and evaluation of DHT-based structured P2P overlay networks.

We further study the effect of non-uniform node bandwidth in handling churn related DHT communications, flash crowd requests and study the tradeoff between bandwidth and latency for evaluating DHT performance during variable churn.

Although, the presented approach can be implemented in any large backbone network that employs multicast communication mode, we concentrate our discussion on MPLS networks. In the proposed approach, a multicast tree is divided into several domains where each domain represents a sub-tree of the original one. Backup paths are built between the root of the domain and each leaf router which is called a border router. Simulation results conducted on two network topologies show the performance of the proposed approach in terms of the total capacity required for reserving the backup paths and in terms of the maximum delay needed to notify about link/node failure. The results have shown that tree division approach compared with global recovery approach reduces the time needed to notify the router that is responsible for switching the traffic to the backup path.","Concordia Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada",,"Banimelhem, O (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",melhem@ece.concordia.ca; aagarwal@ece.concordia.ca; bill@cs.concordia.ca,"Banimelhem, Omar/GQZ-4351-2022",,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,0-7695-2422-2,,,,2005.0,,,,,,,249,254,,10.1109/ICW.2005.19,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICW.2005.19,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BDB90,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000232429900041,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sometimes, they use also simulations to evaluate their proposals; however, these simulations are very specific and cannot be used for other proposals. We believe that there is a need for a simulation framework that can be used to evaluate different pricing schemes. Such a framework will enable the evaluation of Internet pricing schemes using the same realistic environment (e.g., network and traffic).

MPNT is proxy-based, id est its nodes are not end-users but proxies: they act like relays for end-users, providing them standard unicast or multicast access. For scalability and adaptivity reasons, these proxies can be interconnected using different topologies. The first implemented topology is spanning tree based. It is very efficient in terms of switching delay (no routing) but the global delay variance can be important. To remedy this, we implemented an alternate hypercube-based topology. Indeed, hypercubes have several interesting properties that ensure a better scalability. Nevertheless, this logical hypercube optimization is valid provided that interconnecting links are comparable. To adapt the architecture to the network heterogeneity, we implemented thus a hybrid topology exploiting both spanning tree and hypercube advantages.

We claim that the lifetime of a particular route is dependent on all the clusterheads involved in this route. By maintaining the route lifetime, we can keep the network in stable condition as long as possible. Therefore, we propose a localized cluster-based rerouting and resource reservation (LC3R) protocol with packet redundancy over primary and secondary clusterheads chains.

We evaluate the performance of our algorithm and compare its performance with the original IEEE 802.11b protocol. Simulation results show that this new approach reduces packet loss rate and increases throughput in the MAC layer.","Univ Haute Alsace, F-68008 Colmar, France",,"Brahma, M (通讯作者)，Univ Haute Alsace, 34 Rue Grillenbreit, F-68008 Colmar, France.",mohamed.brahma@uha.fr; kwan-woong.kim@uha.fr; abdelhafid.abouaissa@uha.fr; pascal.lorenz@uha.fr,,"abouaissa, abdelhafid/0000-0003-0459-8081",,,,,14,3,3,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,0-7695-2422-2,,,,2005.0,,,,,,,7,12,,10.1109/ICW.2005.12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICW.2005.12,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BDB90,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000232429900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper builds upon previous work on expressing streams causality and propose a multimodal communication toolkit in order to integrate different delivery modes (e.g. FIFO, CAUSAL, TOTAL) into a single channel (with respect to each of these protocols). Moreover the proposed multimodal channel can handle the mix of any partial or total order protocols. We build an experimental platform for measuring the cost of combining several protocols on various network conditions and show how our communication service can adjust the degree of synchronization according to network variations.","ENSEEIHT Informat, IRIT, UMR 5505, CNRS, Toulouse, France",,"Plesca, C (通讯作者)，ENSEEIHT Informat, IRIT, UMR 5505, CNRS, 2 Rue Camichel, Toulouse, France.",,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,0-7695-2422-2,,,,2005.0,,,,,,,216,221,,10.1109/ICW.2005.8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICW.2005.8,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BDB90,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000232429900036,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Standards, Options and Recommendations (SOR) project, started in 1993, is a collaboration between the Federation of the French Cancer Centres (FNCLCC), the 20 French Cancer Centres and specialists from French Public Universities, General Hospitals and Private Clinics. The main objective is the development of clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of health care and outcome for cancer patients. The methodology is based on literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary group of expert, with feedback from specialists in cancer cae delivery. Objectives. To develop clinical practice guidelines according to the definitions of the Standards, Options and Recommendations project for the prevention and the surveillance of cross infection in oncology. Methods. Data were identified by searching Medline(R) and the personal reference lists of members of the expert groups. Once the guidelines were defined, the document was submitted for review to 106 independent reviewers, and to the medical committees of the 20 French Cancer Centres Results. 1) Criteria of infection status and nosocomiality defined by the Centers for Infectious Diseases (CDC) and Prevention and the Superior Counsil of Public Hygiene (CSHPF) are not adapted and have to be redefined in oncology. 2) The epidemiology of nosocomial infections in oncology is not well known but their incidence seems to be higher. Numerous risk factors of cross infections coexist in cancer patients, among which the duration adn depth of neutropenia. 3) Surveillance and prevention of cross infection are compulsory and were taken into account in the accreditation of hospitals. Obligation is expressed in terms of means and results. 4) The objectives of the cross infection surveillance are to detect major problems and critic situations, to guide probabilistic antibiotic therapy and to assess the effectiveness of the infections control. The surveillance means consist in prevalence and incidence survey, punctually and continuously conducted. 5) The three specific behaviors to be adopted to prevent cross infections are to control; all the patients, infected patients carrying multiresistant bacteria, immunodepressed patients. 6) Standards of care have to be applied to all patients with cancer. 7) It is necessary to add particular septic cares for the patients infected with micro-organisms indicated on reference lists or carrying multiresistant bacteria. 8) The only objective of the protective isolation of immunodepressed cancer patients is to reduce thr cross infection. There is not standard behavior for the indications and the modalities of protective isolation. The prevention behaviors to be taken are defined by expert agreements.","FNCLCC, SOR, F-75654 Paris 13, France; Ctr Paul Strauss, Strasbourg, France; CHU Strasbourg, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; Inst Jean Godinoi, F-51056 Reims, France; Inst Curie, Paris, France; Ctr Reg Leon Berard, Lyon, France; Inst Jules Bordet, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; Ctr Paul Papin, Angers, France; Ctr Eugene Marquis, Rennes, France; Ctr Rene Huguenin, St Cloud, France; Ctr Oscar Lambret, F-59020 Lille, France; Ctr Antoine Lacassagne, F-06054 Nice, France",,"Pottecher, B (通讯作者)，FNCLCC, SOR, 101 Rue Tolbiac, F-75654 Paris 13, France.",,"Herbrecht, Raoul/AAT-1763-2021; Herbrecht, Raoul/D-3471-2013; Herbrecht, Raoul/GVU-1333-2022","Herbrecht, Raoul/0000-0002-9381-4876; ",,,,,186,9,9,0,3,JOHN LIBBEY EUROTEXT LTD,ARCUEIL,"30, RUE BERTHOLLET, BATIMENT A, 94110 ARCUEIL, FRANCE",0007-4551,1769-6917,,B CANCER,Bull.

Several QoS routing schemes have been proposed to determine a path which has sufficient bandwidth to achieve the desired QoS requirements. Some of these schemes flood nodes with advertisements to obtain information about congestion on the links. Consequently, protocol overhead is of concern in such cases. Other schemes use source routing to determine the shortest routing path, but security is a major concern for allowing source routing in the Internet [23]. To efficiently support QoS over IP networks, Traffic Engineering (TE) has introduced Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). QoS routing is an essential component of MPLS to maximize network resources. In this paper we propose an approach that sets up a Label Switched Path (LSP) based on the lowest time delay from the ingress to the egress router using only the ingress, rather than requiring all the nodes in the network to exchange information. Our simulation results show that with our proposed approach, we obtain an improvement in the number of packets delivered and better use of network resources. Furthermore, modification of the MPLS domain is not required.","Wayne State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, High Speed Network Lab, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",,"Fowler, S (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, High Speed Network Lab, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",,,"Fowler, Scott/0000-0002-0019-8411",,,,,28,4,4,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,0-7695-2422-2,,,,2005.0,,,,,,,27,32,,10.1109/ICW.2005.70,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICW.2005.70,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BDB90,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000232429900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The performance analysis considers five resource reservation protocols, Just-In-Time (JIT), JumpStart, JIT(+), Just-Enough-Time (JET) and Horizon, and focuses on the following topologies: rings, degree-three chordal rings, degree-four chordal rings, degree-five chordal rings, degree-six chordal rings, mesh-torus, NSFNET, ARPANET and the European Optical Network (EON). It is shown that when the nodal degree increases from 2 to around 3, the largest gain is observed for degree-three chordal rings (slightly less than three orders of magnitude) and the smallest gain is observed for the ARPANET (less than one order of magnitude). On the other hand, when the nodal degree increases from 2 to around 4, the largest gain is observed for degree-four chordal rings (with a gain between four and five orders of magnitude) and the smallest gain is observed for the EON (with a gain less than one order of magnitude). When the nodal degree increases from 2 to around 5 or 6, the gain is between four and six orders of magnitude. These results clearly show the importance of the way links are connected in OBS networks, since, in this kind of networks, burst loss probability is a key issue.

The probability to find a single feasible path which satisfies a VPLS bandwidth requirement is low for connection requests with large bandwidth constraint requirements or when the network is congested. Thus, the proposed algorithm divides the required constraint into sub-constraints and finds the minimum number of optimum P2MP paths that meet the sub-constraint requirement. Most of the work in the area of multi-path routing is focused on partitioning the traffic among multiple point to point (P2P) paths. The traffic is partitioned to reduce the network congestion or to adoptively balance the load among multiple paths based on the network status. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that the algorithm finds the minimum number of paths that satisfy certain bandwidth QoS constraint. Additionally, the multi-path route is calculated to avoid the critical links of other ingress routers and balances the load by choosing paths with maximum residual bandwidth. The proposed algorithm performance is validated using extensive simulation. The results show that the algorithm is capable of increasing the number of admitted requests and improve the network resource utilization by avoiding critical links and choosing paths with maximum residual bandwidth.","Queens Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",,"AbuAli, N (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",,,"AbuAli, Najah/0000-0002-9777-9609; Gazor, Saeed/0000-0003-4368-6682",,,,,9,2,2,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,0-7695-2422-2,,,,2005.0,,,,,,,275,280,,10.1109/ICW.2005.58,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICW.2005.58,,,6,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BDB90,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000232429900045,View Full Record in Web of Science

AmbientApps are applications that can react to the context information with implicit user interaction. Besides providing the context information to AmbientApps, the framework is also characterized by its ability to detect new patterns in sensor data and link them to user actions on devices and pre-empting that user action the next time the same pattern is detected.",,,,james.nj.chen@philips.com; willem.fontijn@philips.com; mylan.chen@philips.com; qinfeng.zhang@philips.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,0-7695-2422-2,,,,2005.0,,,,,,,348,354,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BDB90,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000232429900056,View Full Record in Web of Science

The roles of two design factors effecting performance, the direction selectivity of an array antenna and the direction-of-arrival (DOA) accuracy in the BF algorithm, are examined not only for SNR but also to determine the robustness of a BF algorithm due to error factors of spatial scattering of radio waves and DOA. From the study, it is found that there is a trade-off between the SNR and the robustness with respect to these design factors. The trade-off can be used to achieve an economical implementation of the BF in the CDMA system, which does not have severely deteriorated SNR performance while ensuring its robustness to the error factors.","Chung Ang Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Seoul, South Korea",,"Lee, JS (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, 221 Huksuk Dong, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,0-7695-2422-2,,,,2005.0,,,,,,,45,48,,10.1109/CSBW.2005.38,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CSBW.2005.38,,,4,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BDB90,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000232429900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods. - A descriptive, national, cross-sectional survey was conducted in 14 French geriatric departments (12 teaching hospitals and two general hospitals). In each department, five patients receiving transfusions were randomly selected in order to analyze their characteristics, the indications of blood transfusion, the criteria for and the methods of transfusion compared with Afssaps recommendations on transfusion thresholds. Results. - Data were analyzed for 70 patients (mean age 86 +/- 7 years, sex ratio female to male 1.8, with an average of five +/- two pathologies and six +/- three treatments). The indicators of poor tolerance included confusion (23 %), somnolence (22 %), acute heart failure (17 %) or coronary heart disease (16 %), and differed from the Afssaps criteria in the majority of cases. The transfusion threshold that were considered in the absence of poor tolerance (45 % of transfusions) differed from that recommended by Afssaps in 26 % of cases. The main adverse event in transfusion recipients was heart failure. Conclusion. - When criteria for poor anaemia tolerance or transfusion thresholds are considered, transfusion practices in geriatric subjects have specific features. Further studies are needed to validate the appropriateness of the practices described in this survey. (C) 2009 Societe nationale francaise de medecine interne (SNFMI).

Data Extraction: The RCTs, meta-analyses, and cost-effectiveness studies were critically appraised by 2 reviewers to assess the clinical evidence level according to a modification of Sackett's 1989 criteria. Ninety-three articles were finally graded. Data Synthesis: We found no level A studies, 14 level B studies (11 RCTs and 3 meta-analyses), and 79 level C studies. Hydrocolloid dressings proved superior to saline gauze or paraffin gauze dressings for the complete healing of chronic wounds, and alginates were better than other modern dressings for debriding necrotic wounds. Hydrofiber and foam dressings, when compared with other traditional dressings or a silver-coated dressing, respectively, reduced time to healing of acute wounds. Conclusions: Our systematic review provided only weak levels of evidence on the clinical efficacy of modern dressings compared with saline or paraffin gauze in terms of healing, with the exception of hydrocolloids. There was no evidence that any of the modern dressings was better than another, or better than saline or paraffin gauze, in terms of general performance criteria. More wound care research providing level A evidence is needed.","Hop Tenon, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, F-75970 Paris, France; Hop Rothschild, Assistance Publ Hop Paris, Dermatol Consultat, Paris, France; Haute Autorite Sante, Saint Denis, France; Ctr Hosp Gen Colmar, Dept Dermatol, Colmar, France; Hop Lapeyronie, Plast Surg Ctr, Dept Orthoped Surg & Burn, Montpellier, France; Hop Broussais, Assistance Publ Hop Paris, Dept Vasc Rehabilitat, Paris, France; Ctr Hosp Univ Caen, Dept Dermatol, Caen, France; Ctr Hosp Reg & Univ Lille, Dept Pharmacol, Lille, France; Hop Instruct Armees Percy, Dept Burn, Clamart, France; Ctr Hosp Bar Duc, Dept Pharmacol, Bar Le Duc, France; Ctr Hosp Univ Nimes, Ctr Med, Dept Nutr Dis & Diabetol, Nimes, France; Ctr Reeduc Coubert, Dept Phys Med & Rehabil, Courbevoie, France; Assistance Publ Hop Marseille, Dept Pharmacol, Marseille, France; Hop Instruct Armees Clermont Tonnerre, Dept Dermatol, Brest, France; Ctr Hosp Univ Montpellier, Dept Dermatol, Montpellier, France; Ctr Hosp Univ Amiens, Dept Dermatol, Amiens, France; Hop Charles Foix, Assistance Publ Hop Paris, Dept Geriatr, Ivry, France; Univ Paris 06, Hop Tenon, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, Assistance Publ Hop Paris, Paris, France",,"Chosidow, O (通讯作者)，Hop Tenon, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, F-75970 Paris, France.",olivier.Chosidow@tnn.aphp.fr,,,,,,,115,150,154,1,103,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",0003-987X,1538-3652,,ARCH DERMATOL,Arch.

Pores are comprised of a few atoms missing in the two-dimensional (2D) lattice (1-5 Mo atoms) of characteristic sizes from similar to 0.5 to similar to 1.2 nm, and pore edges directly probed by AC-STEM to map the atomic structure. We categorize them into similar to 30 geometrically possible zigzag, armchair, and mixed configurations. While theoretical studies predict that transport properties of 2D pores in this size range depend strongly on pore size and their atomic configuration, OD pores show an average conductance in the range from similar to 0.6-1 nS (bias up to 0.1 V), similar to biological pores. In some devices, the current was immeasurably small and/or pores could not be wet. Furthermore, current-voltage (I-V) characteristics are largely independent of bulk molarity (10 mM to 3 M KCl) and the type of cation (K+, Li+, Mg2+). This work lays the experimental foundation for understanding of the confinement effects possible in atomic-scale 2D material pores and the realization of solid-state analogues of ion channels in biology.","[Thiruraman, Jothi Priyanka; Das, Paul Masih; Drndic, Marija] Univ Penn, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Thiruraman, Jothi Priyanka] Univ Penn, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Drndic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Phys & Astron, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",drndic@physics.upenn.edu,"Thiruraman, Jothi Priyanka/AAO-6679-2021",,"NSF through the University of Pennsylvania Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) [DMR-1720530]; NSF [EFRI 2-DARE 1542707, NSF DMR 1905045, NSF EAGER 1838456, ECCS-1542153]; NIH [R21 HG010536]; Vagelos Institute of Energy Science and Technology",NSF through the University of Pennsylvania Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Vagelos Institute of Energy Science and Technology,"AC-STEM imaging and nanopore drilling were executed at the Center for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology at Lehigh University with assistance from Dr. Robert Keyse.

We conducted a nationwide survey that included patients with HCV-negative CryoVas. We describe here the presentation, therapeutic management and outcome of 18 patients with non-HCV infectious CryoVas and 27 additional patients identified form a systematic review of the literature. We included 18 patients, mean age 57.9 +/- 13.5 years. Infectious causes were viral infections in 8 patients [hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 4, and cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, parvovirus B19 and human immunodeficiency virus in one case each], pyogenic bacterial infection in 6 patients, parasitic infection in 2 patients, and leprosy and candidiasis in one case each. Baseline manifestations were purpura (78%), glomerulonephritis (28%), arthralgia (28%), peripheral neuropathy (22%), skin necrosis (22%), cutaneous ulcers (17%), and myalgia (11%). Cryoglobulinemia was type II in 2/3 of cases. Most cases received specific anti-infectious therapy as first-line therapy, sometimes associated with corticosteroids, achieving sustained remission in the majority of cases. Refractory or relapsing patients, frequently related to HBV infection, showed a complete remission after rituximab in addition to antiviral therapy. In contrast, corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents used in the absence of anti-infectious agents were frequently associated with refractory CryoVas. Viral and pyogenic bacterial infections represent the main causes of non-HCV infectious CryoVas. Antimicrobial therapy is commonly associated with sustained remission. Immunosuppressive agents should be considered only as a second-line option in patients with refractory vasculitis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Doppler measurement is an extension of standard civil marine radar technology. While intensity images require interpretation based on understanding the underlying imaging mechanism, the Doppler signal measures the motion of an area of sea surface and is therefore closely related to the wave physics. Both the measured Doppler signal and the backscatter intensity signal are suitable for surface inversion and give almost identical surface elevations. A statistical comparison with a nearby buoy showed good correlation for the significant wave height and the peak period.

To analyze the presentation, prognosis, and efficacy and safety of treatments of type I CryoVas, we conducted a French nationwide survey that included 64 patients with type I CryoVas between January 1995 and July 2010: 28 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) and 36 with hematologic malignancy. Type I monoclonal CryoVas was characterized by severe cutaneous involvement (necrosis and ulcers) in almost half the patients and high serum cryoglobulin levels, contrasting with a lower frequency of glomerulonephritis than expected. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 97%, 94%, 94%, and 87%, respectively. Compared to MGUS, type I CryoVas related to hematologic malignancy tended to be associated with a poorer prognosis. Therapeutic regimens based on alkylating agents, rituximab, thalidomide or lenalinomide, and bortezomib showed similar efficacy on vasculitis manifestations, with clinical response rates from 80% to 86%. Data from the CryoVas survey show that the prognosis of type I CryoVas does not seem to be as poor as previously suggested. Besides alkylating agents, the use of regimens based on rituximab, thalidomide or lenalinomide, and bortezomib are interesting alternative options, although the exact role of each strategy remains to be defined.

Methods: Venous blood samples were taken from the candidates' peripheral veins into the EDTA tube and examined for red blood cell(RBC) count, Hb, hematocrit (%),MCV, MCH, MCHC, and red cell distribution width (RDW), analyzed and measured by automated blood analyzer. Results: The mean Hb level was 14.428 +/- 1.485g/dl, RBCs count was 4.744 +/- 0.482x10(12)/L, HCT was 41.929 +/- 3.75%, RDW mean was 13.571 +/- 0.744%, MCV was 88.582 +/- 4.0558 Femtoliter, MCH was 30.470 +/- 2.188 picogram, and MCHC was a mean of 34.393 +/- 1.347g/dl. The difference between males and females in MCV and MCHC was significant in favor of female donors. A correlation of a weak positive nature was found between the ages and genders of donors and the Hb level. All measured values were found to be within the global referenced ranges. Conclusion: Hb, RBCs count, and RBCs indices of apparently healthy Eritrean blood donors were measured for reference, and all values were found to be within the normal reference ranges.","[Abdon, Faris M.] Orotta Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Biochem, Asmera, Eritrea; [Adgoy, Elias T.] Orotta Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Community Med & Primary Hlth Care, Asmera, Eritrea; [Berhane, Nahom Y.; Ibrahim, Senet A.] Natl Blood Transfus Serv NBTS, Dept Lab Med, Asmera, Eritrea; [Khalil, Adil K.

A prospective study in patients with SCD to identify factors associated with complete healing and recurrence of LUs is lacking. Objectives To determine clinical and biological factors associated with SCD-LU complete healing and recurrence. Methods This prospective, observational cohort study was conducted at two adult SCD referral-centre sites (2009-2015) and included 98 consecutive patients with at least one LU lasting >= 2 weeks. The primary end points compared patients with healed vs. nonhealed LUs at week 24, and patients with vs. without recurrence during follow-up. Results The median (interquartile range) LU area, duration and follow-up were, respectively, 6.2 cm(2) (3-12.8), 9 weeks (4-26) and 65.8 weeks (23.8-122.1). At week 24, LUs were healed in 47% of patients, while 49% of LUs recurred. Univariate analyses identified inclusion LU area < 8 cm(2) (82% vs. 35%; P < 0.001), inclusion LU duration < 9 weeks (65% vs. 35%; P = 0.0013) and high median fetal haemoglobin level (P = 0.008) as being significantly associated with complete healing at week 24, and low lactate dehydrogenase level (P = 0.038) as being associated with recurrence. Multivariate analyses retained LU area < 8 cm 2 (odds ratio 6.73, 95% confidence interval 2.35-19.31; P < 0.001) and < 9 weeks' duration (OR 3.19, 95% confidence interval 1.16-8.76; P = 0.024) as being independently associated with healing at week 24. Factors independently associated with recurrence could not be identified. Conclusions SCD-LU complete healing is independently associated with the clinical characteristics of LUs rather than the clinical or biological characteristics of SCD.","[Senet, P.] Hop Tenon, APHP, Serv Dermatol, 4 Rue Chine, F-75970 Paris 20, France; [Blas-Chatelain, C.; Mirault, T.; Debure, C.; Bureau, J. -M.] Hop Corentin Celton, APHP, Serv Reeduc Vasc, 4 Parvis Corentin Celton,BP 66, F-92133 Issy Les Moulineaux, France; [Levy, P.] Univ Paris 06, Hop Tenon, APHP, Serv Sante Publ, Paris, France; [Levy, P.] INSERM, UMR S 1136, Paris, France; [Manea, E.

GvHD induces tissue damage and the release of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules. Here, we analyzed GvHD patients (n = 39) to show that serum heat shock protein glycoprotein 96 (Gp96) could be such a DAMP molecule. We demonstrate that serum Gp96 increases in gastrointestinal GvHD patients and its level correlates with disease severity. An increase in Gp96 serum level was also observed in a mouse model of acute GvHD. This model was used to identify complement C3 as a main partner of Gp96 in the serum. Our biolayer interferometry, yeast two-hybrid and in silico modeling data allowed us to determine that Gp96 binds to a complement C3 fragment encompassing amino acids 749-954, a functional complement C3 hot spot important for binding of different regulators. Accordingly, in vitro experiments with purified proteins demonstrate that Gp96 downregulates several complement C3 functions. Finally, experimental induction of GvHD in complement C3-deficient mice confirms the link between Gp96 and complement C3 in the serum and with the severity of the disease.","[Seignez, Antoine; Joly, Anne-Laure; Chaumonnot, Killian; Hazoume, Adonis; Sanka, Michel; Marcion, Guillaume; Boudesco, Christophe; Hammann, Arlette; Seigneuric, Renaud; Jego, Gaetan; Kohli, Evelyne; Garrido, Carmen] Ligue Natl Canc, INSERM UMR 866, Equipe Labellisee, Dijon, France; [Seignez, Antoine; Joly, Anne-Laure; Chaumonnot, Killian; Hazoume, Adonis; Sanka, Michel; Marcion, Guillaume; Boudesco, Christophe; Hammann, Arlette; Seigneuric, Renaud; Jego, Gaetan; Kohli, Evelyne; Garrido, Carmen] Lab Excellence LipSTIC, Dijon, France; [Seignez, Antoine; Joly, Anne-Laure; Chaumonnot, Killian; Hazoume, Adonis; Sanka, Michel; Marcion, Guillaume; Boudesco, Christophe; Hammann, Arlette; Seigneuric, Renaud; Jego, Gaetan; Kohli, Evelyne; Garrido, Carmen] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, LNC UMR 866, Dijon, France; [Seignez, Antoine; Kohli, Evelyne] CHU, Dijon, France; [Ducoroy, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Prote Platform CLIPP, Dijon, France; [Delarue, Patrice; Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, UMR CNRS Inst Carnot 6303, Dijon, France; [Castilla-Llorente, Cristina; Solary, Eric] Univ Paris Sud 11, Inst Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; [Solary, Eric] Inst Gustave Roussy, INSERM UMR1009, Villejuif, France; [Durey, Marie-Agnes] Hop Europeen Georges Pompidou, AP HP, Immunol Dept, Paris, France; [Durey, Marie-Agnes] Univ Paris 05, Paris, France; [Rubio, Marie-Therese] Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Serv Hematol & Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France; [Rubio, Marie-Therese] Univ Paris 06, INSERM UMR 938, Paris, France; [Hermine, Olivier] Univ Paris 05, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Inst Imagine, UMR 8147, Paris, France; [Hermine, Olivier] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, AP HP, Paris, France; [Hermine, Olivier] Lab Excellence Globules Rouges GR Ex, Paris, France; [Garrido, Carmen] Anticanc Ctr Georges Francois Leclerc, Dijon, France",,"Garrido, C (通讯作者)，UFR Sci Sante, INSERM U866, 7 Blvd Jeanne dArc, F-21079 Dijon, France.",cgarrido@u-bourgogne.fr,"Hermine, Olivier/Q-7072-2018; Garrido, Carolina/GWM-5557-2022; jego, gaetan/N-7226-2018; Garrido, carmen/G-1633-2018","jego, gaetan/0000-0003-0376-9299; Garrido, carmen/0000-0003-1368-1493; Hermine, Olivier/0000-0003-2574-3874; Marcion, Guillaume/0000-0002-3634-6316; Solary, Eric/0000-0002-8629-1341","Institut National du Cancer, Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer; Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC); Conseil Regional de Bourgogne; French Government [ANR-11-LABX-0021]; European Union; La Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer; l'ARC","Institut National du Cancer, Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer (ARC)(Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer); Conseil Regional de Bourgogne(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte); French Government; European Union(European Commission); La Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer(Ligue nationale contre le cancer); l'ARC","We thank Galit Rotman and Anat Oren (Compugen Ltd., Tel Aviv, Israel) for giving us the CGEN-25007 peptide aptamer and for their advise.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a tool capable of identifying clonal myeloid cells in the skin infiltrate and thus better characterize the link between hematological diseases and skin lesions. Objective To assess whether skin lesions of MDS/CMML are clonally related to blood or bone marrow cells using NGS. Methods Comparisons of blood or bone marrow and skin samples NGS findings from patients presenting with MDS/CMML and skin lesions in three French hospitals. Results Among the 14 patients recruited, 12 patients (86%) had mutations in the skin lesions biopsied, 12 patients (86%) had a globally similar mutational profile between blood/bone marrow and skin, and 10 patients (71%) had mutations with a high variant allele frequency (>10%) found in the myeloid skin infiltrate. Mutations in TET2 and DNMT3A, both in four patients, were the most frequent. Two patients harbored a UBA1 mutation on hematopoietic samples. Limitations Limited number of patients and retrospective collection of the data. Blood and skin sampling were not performed at the exact same time point for two patients. Conclusion Skin lesions in the setting of MDS/CMML are characterized by a clonal myeloid infiltrate in most cases.","[de Fremont, Gregoire Martin; Adedjouma, Amir; Abisror, Noemie; Mahevas, Thibault; Fain, Olivier; Mekinian, Arsene] Univ Paris 06, Sorborine Univ, Hop St Antoine, AP HP,Serv Med Interne & Inflammat,Dept Med Univ, Paris, France; [Hirsch, Pierre] Univ Paris 06, Sorborine Univ, Hop St Antoine, AP HP,Ctr Rech St Antoine,Serv Hematol Biol,INSER, Paris, France; [de Mestral, Santiago Gimenez; Ditchi, Yoan] Univ Paris 06, Sorborine Univ, Hop St Antoine, AP HP,Serv Anatomopathol, Paris, France; [Moguelet, Philippe] Hop Ambroise Pare, AP HP, Serv Anatomopathol, Boulogne Billancourt, France; [Moguelet, Philippe] Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, Boulogne Billancourt, France; [Emile, Jean-Francois] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Hop Tenon, AP HP,Serv Anatomopalhol, Paris, France; [Senet, Patricia; Chasset, Francois] Univ Paris 06, Serv Dermatol, Hop Tenon, AP HP,Sorbonne Univ, Paris, France; [Georgin-Lavialle, Sophie] Univ Paris 06, Serv Med Interne, Hop Tenon, AP HP,Sorbonne Univ, Paris, France; [Hanslik, Thomas] Hop Ambroise Pare, AP HP, Serv Med Interne, Boulogne Bilancourt, France; [Hanslik, Thomas] Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, Boulogne Bilancourt, France; [Maurier, Francois] Grp Hosp UNEOS, Serv Med Interne & Immunol Clin, Metz, France; [Malard, Florent] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Hop St Antoine, AP HP,Serv Hematol Clin, Paris, France; [Ades, Lionel; Fenaux, Pierre] Hop St Louis, AP HP, Serv Hematol, Paris, France; [Ades, Lionel; Fenaux, Pierre] Univ Paris, Paris, France",,"Mekinian, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 06, Sorborine Univ, Hop St Antoine, AP HP,Serv Med Interne & Inflammat,Dept Med Univ, Paris, France.",arsene.mekinian@aphp.fr,,,,,,,28,0,0,1,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-3224,,,FRONT IMMUNOL,Front.

Fifty-one serum samples with toxoplasmosis antibody titres ranging from 0 to 900 IU were tested in two successive studies with 16 ELISA-IgG kits. For the negative sera, false-positive reactions were observed with one kit. For the positive sera, the titres observed in ELISA were generally higher than those expressed in IU. Above 250 IU, the very wide variability of the titres found with the different ELISA kits renders any comparative analysis impossible. For titres below 250 IU, the results are sufficiently homogeneous to permit the use of regression analysis to study how the results for each ELISA kit compare with the mean results for the other kits. The slope of the line of regression shows a tendency to over-titration or under-titration compared with the results of the other manufacturers; the ordinate at the origin reflects the positivity threshold of the reaction and can be used to assess the risk of a lack of sensitivity (high threshold) or of specificity (threshold too low). On the whole, the trends revealed for a given manufacturer are constant from one study to the other. Within this range of titres, regression analysis also reveals the general tendency of ELISA kits to overestimate the titres by comparison with immunofluorescence. This collaborative study, using a set of selected sera and a simple method of analysis, made it possible to propose a new approach to standardizing the various ELISA kits.","SYNDICAT FABRICANTS REACT LAB,F-75008 PARIS,FRANCE; CTR HOSP GONESSE,F-95500 GONESSE,FRANCE",,"DEROUIN, F (通讯作者)，HOP ST LOUIS,PARASITOL LAB,1 AVE CLAUDE VELLEFAUX,F-75475 PARIS 10,FRANCE.",,,,,,,,10,7,7,0,0,WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION,GENEVA 27,"DISTRIBUTION AND SALES, CH-1211 GENEVA 27, SWITZERLAND",0042-9686,,,B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN,Bull.

We aimed to identify predictors of early relapses occurring within the first 12 months of treatment in such patients. Methods: Patients included in the French CryoVas survey exhibiting complete/partial clinical remission and followed-up for at least 12 months after induction therapy (n = 145) were analyzed for predictors of early relapses. Results: Forty out of 145 patients (28%) experienced early relapse. Relapses occurred after a median time of 9.5 months after induction therapy (3-12) and involved skin (75%), joints and peripheral nerve (28% each), kidneys (25%) and gastrointestinal tract (5%). Baseline factors associated with an early relapse were purpura [HR 3.35 (1.02-10.97), P = 0.0461], cutaneous necrosis [HR 4.46 (1.58-12.57), P = 0.0051] and articular involvement [HR 2.20 (1.00-4.78), P = 0.0481]. The only factor negatively associated with an early relapse during follow-up was the achievement of complete immunological response [HR 0.07 (0.01-0.51), P = 0.0091]. The use of corticosteroids plus rituximab or cyclophosphamide tended to be associated negatively with early relapse [HR 0.43 (0.17-1.08), P = 0.07]. Conclusion: In patients with non-infectious CryoVas, main predictors of early relapses after initial remission are purpura, articular involvement, and cutaneous necrosis. The absence of complete immunological response during follow-up was associated with early relapse. These findings may help in adapting future treatment strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We analyzed data from 242 patients with noninfectious mixed CryoVas included in the French multicenter CryoVas survey. Baseline manifestations were purpura (75%), peripheral neuropathy (52%), arthralgia or arthritis (44%), glomerulonephritis (35%), cutaneous ulcers (16%), and cutaneous necrosis (14%). A connective tissue disease was diagnosed in 30% and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 22%, whereas the CryoVas was considered to be essential in 48%. With the use of Cox-marginal structural models, rituximab plus corticosteroids showed the greater therapeutic efficacy compared with corticosteroids alone and alkylating agents plus corticosteroids to achieve complete clinical, renal, and immunologic responses and a prednisone dosage < 10 mg/d at 6 months.

The commercial availability of DHEA outside the regular pharmaceutical-medical network in the United States creates a real public health problem that may be resolved only by appropriate long-term clinical trials in elderly men and women. Two hundred and eighty healthy individuals (women and men 60-79 years old) were given DHEA, 50 mg, or placebo, orally, daily for a year in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. No potentially harmful accumulation of DHEAS and active steroids was recorded. Besides the reestablishment of a young concentration of DHEAS, a small increase of testosterone and estradiol was noted, particularly in women, and may be involved in the significantly demonstrated physiological-clinical manifestations here reported. Bone turnover improved selectively in women >70 years old, as assessed by the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) technique and the decrease of osteoclastic activity. A significant increase in most libido parameters was also found in these older women. Improvement of the skin status was observed, particularly in women, in terms of hydration, epidermal thickness, sebum production, and pigmentation. A number of biological indices confirmed the lack of harmful consequences of this 50 mg/day DHEA administration over one year, also indicating that this kind of replacement therapy normalized some effects of aging, but does not create supermen/women (doping).","Coll France, Inst Natl Sante, F-94276 Le Kremlin Bicetre, France; Coll France, Rech Med Unit 488, F-94276 Le Kremlin Bicetre, France; Hop St Antoine, Inst Natl Sante, F-75012 Paris, France; Hop St Antoine, Rech Med Unit 444, F-75012 Paris, France; Hop Bichat, F-75877 Paris, France; Hop St Vincent de Paul, F-75014 Paris, France; Hop Paul Brousse, F-94804 Villejuif, France; Fdn Natl Gerontol, F-75016 Paris, France; Hop Charles Foix, F-94205 Ivry, France; Hop Bicetre, F-94275 Le Kremlin Bicetre, France; Hop Broca, F-75013 Paris, France; Ctr Jack Senet, F-75015 Paris, France; Hop St Perine, F-75016 Paris, France; Observ Age, F-75017 Paris, France; LOreal, F-92583 Clichy, France; Inst Sexol, F-75116 Paris, France; Hop Necker Enfants Malad, F-75015 Paris, France; Hop Broussais, F-75014 Paris, France; Hop Trousseau, F-75012 Paris, France",,"Baulieu, EE (通讯作者)，Coll France, Inst Natl Sante, F-94276 Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.",,,,,,,,27,431,454,0,15,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

This reputation is based on intermittent ground and aerial surveys performed since 1958. From an aerial survey obtained on 28 October 2010 we discovered that the total number of chicks was 56% of the lowest previous estimate of 2006 and only 41% of the most recent estimate in 2008. All of the counts tallied since 1983 were determined either by ground counts or from aerial film or digital photographs, or estimates from adult counts. We also determined the sea ice conditions in autumn, which is close to the time the adults arrive to breed. We present three hypotheses of what might have happened from 2008-10 to cause the step change in chick production, the small recovery of chick numbers in 2011, and the complete recovery of number of adults from 2010-11. We conclude that local circumstances may have strongly influenced the breeding behaviour of the emperor penguins in 2010 and to a lesser degree in 2011 when many adults elected not to breed.","Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,"Kooyman, GL (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Scholander Hall,9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",gkooyman@ucsd.edu,,", gerald/0000-0002-8872-2950","NSF [OPP 98-14794, OPP02-29638, OPP 02-24957, DPP 83-16963, DPP86-13729, DPP 87-15863, DPP 871584, OPP 92-19872, OPP 96-15390, OPP 0001450]; Tinker Foundation Inc",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Tinker Foundation Inc,"We dedicate this report to the memory of John Dearborn (now deceased), who shared his notes and photographs with GLK in 2010 about the discovery and first visit to Coulman Island.

Subgroups of capillaroscopic scleroderma landscape have been correlated with stages of SSc: two groups for Maricq's classification (slow and active), and three for Cutolo's classification (early, active and late). We report inter-and intra-observer agreement for these classifications as a preliminary step in the multicentre prospective SCLEROCAP study, which aims to assess the classification and single capillaroscopic items as prognostic tools for SSc. Methods. SCLEROCAP included 385 patients. Agreement was studied in the first 100 patients, who were independently rated twice by two observers, blind to patients' characteristics; 30 of the patients were rated once by six observers. After consensus meetings, these ratings were held again. Kappa and intra-class correlation coefficients were used to assess agreement. Results. Interobserver agreement on 100 patients was moderate for Maricq and Cutolo classifications [ kappa 0.47 (0.28, 0.66) and 0.49 (0.33, 0.65), respectively], and became substantial after consensus meetings [0.64 (0.50, 0.77) and 0.69 (0.56, 0.81)]. Intra-observer agreement between two observers was moderate to substantial: kappa 0.54 (0.33, 0.75) and 0.70 (0.57, 0.83) for Maricq's classification; 0.57 (0.38, 0.77) and 0.76 (0.65, 0.87) for Cutolo's. Thirty patients were rated once by each of six observers, and agreement was moderate to substantial: kappa 0.57 +/- 0.10 (Maricq) and 0.61 +/- 0.12 (Cutolo). Agreement was substantial for bushy, giant capillaries and microhaemorrhages, moderate for capillary density and low for oedema, disorganization and avascular areas. Conclusion. The moderate reproducibility of Maricq and Cutolo classifications might hamper their prognostic value in SSc patients. Consensus meetings improve reliability, a prerequisite for better prognostic performances. A focus on giant capillaries, haemorrhages and capillary density might be more reliable.","[Boulon, Carine; Mangin, Marion; Skopinski, Sophie; Constans, Joel] Hop St Andre, Serv Med Vasc, 1 Rue Jean Burguet, F-33075 Bordeaux, France; [Devos, Sophie] CHU Bordeaux, Pole Sante Publ, Unite Soutien Methodol Rech Clin & Epidemiol, Bordeaux, France; [Decamps-Le Chevoir, Joelle] Hop Pitie, Serv Med Interne, Paris, France; [Senet, Patricia; Baudot, Nathalie] Hop Tenon, Serv Dermatol Med Vasc & Allergol, Paris, France; [Lazareth, Isabelle; Tribout, Laurent] Hop St Joseph, Serv Med Vasc, Paris, France; [Imbert, Bernard; Blaise, Sophie; Carpentier, Patrick] CHU Grenoble Alpes, Serv Med Vasc, La Tronche, France; [Sintes, Pierre] Clin Princes, Med Vasc, Boulogne Billancourt, France; [Lapebie, Francois-Xavier] Hop Rangueil, Serv Med Vasc, Toulouse, France; [Lacroix, Philippe] Hop Dupuytren, Serv Med Vasc, Limoges, France; [Truchetet, Marie-Elise] Hop Pellegrin, Serv Rhumatol, Bordeaux, France; [Seneschal, Julien] Hop St Andre, Serv Dermatol, Bordeaux, France; [Solanilla, Anne] Clin Mutualiste Lesparre, Serv Med Interne, Lesparre, France; [Lazaro, Estibaliz] Hop Haut Leveque, Serv Med Interne & Malad Infect, Pessac, France; [Quere, Isabelle] Hop St Eloi, Serv Med Vasc, Montpellier, France; [Pistorius, Marc-Antoine] Hop Hotel Dieu, Serv Med Vasc, Nantes, France; [Le Hello, Claire] CHU St Etienne, Hop Nord, Serv Med Vasc, St Etienne, France; [Perez, Paul] Univ Bordeaux, INSERM EC CIC1401, Bordeaux, France",,"Boulon, C (通讯作者)，Hop St Andre, Serv Med Vasc, 1 Rue Jean Burguet, F-33075 Bordeaux, France.",carine.boulon@chu-bordeaux.fr,"Blaise, Sophie/AAD-4476-2019; Quere, Isabelle/AAB-8519-2020; Blaise, Sophie/AAS-2389-2020","Blaise, Sophie/0000-0001-7238-112X; Quere, Isabelle/0000-0002-1492-9764; Blaise, Sophie/0000-0001-7238-112X; Seneschal, Julien/0000-0003-1139-0908",Societe Francaise de Medecine Vasculaire; Societe Francaise de Microcirculation; Actelion Pharma ceuticals,Societe Francaise de Medecine Vasculaire; Societe Francaise de Microcirculation; Actelion Pharma ceuticals,"Societe Francaise de Medecine Vasculaire, Societe Francaise de Microcirculation, Actelion Pharma ceuticals.",,22,19,19,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1462-0324,1462-0332,,RHEUMATOLOGY,RHEUMATOLOGY,OCT,2017.0,56,10,,,,,1713,1720,,10.1093/rheumatology/kex246,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/kex246,,,8,Rheumatology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Rheumatology,FH9GG,28957554.0,Bronze,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000411518400016,View Full Record in Web of Science

This systematic review assessed the interest in diet for managing CSU. We searched for original reports in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and LILACS. Among the 278 reports screened, 20 were included, involving 1,734 patients. Reports described 3 types of systematic diet: pseudoallergen-free diet (n = 1,555 patients), low-histamine diet (n = 223) and diet without fish products (n = 47), which induced complete remission in 4.8%, 11.7% and 10.6% of patients, respectively, and partial remission in 37.0%, 43.9% and 4.3%. Eight reports described personalized exclusion diets (66 patients) adapted to symptoms/allergological test results and led to complete remission in 74.6% of patients, although the diagnosis of CSU was doubtful. No comparative randomized studies of diets were available. The only randomized studies were based on oral provocation tests with the suspected responsible diet. Population and outcomes were heterogeneous. In conclusion, there is evidence for the benefit of diets in CSU only in individual patients with clinical symptoms. However, the level of evidence is low for the benefit of systematic diets in CSU because systematic double-blind controlled trials of diet are lacking.","[Cornillier, Helene; Samimi, Mahtab; Maruani, Annabel] Univ Francois Rabelais Tours, Dept Dermatol, CHRU Tours, Tours, France; [Giraudeau, Bruno; Jonville-Bera, Annie-Pierre; Maruani, Annabel] Univ Tours & Nantes, SPHERE INSERM 1246, Tours, France; [Munck, Stephane] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Dept Teaching & Res Gen Practice, Nice, France; [Hacard, Florence] Univ Hosp Ctr Lyon, Dept Allergol & Immunol, Lyon, France; [Jonville-Bera, Annie-Pierre] CHRU Tours, Dept Clin Pharmacol, Tours, France; [Jegou, Marie-Helene] Dermatol Off, Blanquefort, France; [D'Acremont, Gwenaelle] Pediat Off, Paris, France; [Bach-nga Pham] Univ Hosp Ctr Reims, Lab Immunol, Reims, France; [Chosidow, Olivier] UPEC, Hosp Henri Mondor, AP HP, EA EpiDermE 7379, Creteil, France; [Chosidow, Olivier] UPEC, Hosp Henri Mondor, AP HP, CIC INSERM 1430, Creteil, France",,"Cornillier, H (通讯作者)，Hosp Trousseau, CHRU Tours, Dept Dermatol, Ave Republ, FR-37044 Tours 9, France.",helene.cornillier@etu-univ-tours.fr,"Giraudeau, Bruno/L-9003-2015; Sbidian, Emilie/ABH-5714-2020; samimi, mahtab/V-3038-2019; Beylot-Barry, Marie/AHC-3163-2022","Giraudeau, Bruno/0000-0003-3031-8258; Jonville-Bera, Annie Pierre/0000-0002-2635-3360; Maruani, Annabel/0000-0003-3734-810X; Florence, Hacard/0000-0001-8300-1233","Centre de Preuves en Dermatologie, France","Centre de Preuves en Dermatologie, France","This work was supported by Centre de Preuves en Dermatologie, France",,44,15,15,0,3,ACTA DERMATO-VENEREOLOGICA,UPPSALA,"TRADGARDSGATAN 14, UPPSALA, SE-753 09, SWEDEN",0001-5555,1651-2057,,ACTA DERM-VENEREOL,Acta Derm.-Venereol.,FEB,2019.0,99,2,,,,,127,132,,10.2340/00015555-3015,http://dx.doi.org/10.2340/00015555-3015,,,6,Dermatology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Dermatology,HI9RC,30085322.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000456794300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objectives of this work were thus to report on the efficacy and safety of IVIG in a population of SSc patients and to review the available literature. Methods: 46 patients from 19 French centers were retrospectively recruited. They were included if they had a diagnosis of SSc and received at least 1 IVIG infusion at a dosage >1 g/kg/cycle. Relevant data collected at IVIG discontinuation were compared to those collected at IVIG initiation. A comprehensive literature review was performed. Results: We observed a significant improvement of muscle pain (74% vs. 20%, p < 0.0001), muscle weakness (45% vs. 21%, p = 0.01), joint pain (44% vs. 19%, p = 0.02), CK levels (1069 +/- 1552 UI vs. 288 +/- 449 UI, p < 0.0001) and CRP levels (13.1 +/- 17.6 mg/L vs. 9.2 +/- 16.6 mg/L, p = 0.001). We also noted a trend for an improvement of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (68% vs. 53%, p = 0.06) and bowel symptoms (42% vs. 27%, p = 0.06). Skin and cardiorespiratory involvements remained stable. Finally, corticosteroid daily dose was significantly lower by the end of treatment (13.0 +/- 11.6 mg/day vs. 8.9 +/- 10.4 mg/day, p = 0.01). Only two severe adverse events were reported (one case of deep vein thrombosis and one case of diffuse edematous syndrome). Conclusion: Our work suggests that WIG are a safe therapeutic option that may be effective in improving musculoskeletal involvement, systemic inflammation, digestive tract symptoms and could be corticosteroid sparing.

Very few studies are available on this topic. The aim of our study was to describe the demographic, clinical and etiological characteristics as well as the course of CW in drug addicts. Patients and methods. - This was a retrospective and prospective multicenter study including all drug addicts with CW. Results. - We included 58 patients (17 prospectively), 84.5% of whom were male, of median age 43 years, presenting multiple CW as a result of intravenous (78.2%), inhaled (41.1%) and/or snorted (20%) drug abuse. Addiction to opioids (68.4%), cocaine (47.4%) and/or cannabis (40.4%) was ended and/or treated through substitution in 79.3% of patients. CW were fibrinous and necrotic (42.9 to 53.6%), recurrent (54.2%), and in some cases had been present for more than 1 year (61.5%). Intravenous drug addiction was associated with large, fibrinous, ulcers in a setting of venous and lymphatic insufficiency (74%). Only 23% of these wounds involved the upper limbs. Necrotic ulcers associated with clinical arteriopathy were described mainly with inhaled addiction. Abscesses (50%) and erysipelas (29.3%) were the most common cutaneous complications. After 3 months, 50% of CW were improved and 29.2% of patients were lost to follow-up. Discussion. - Drug abuse-related CW occurred preferentially in young men with history of intravenous abuse. For the most part, CW were seen on the legs and were associated with venous and lymphatic insufficiency, and the resulting major risk for cutaneous infection increased morbidity and mortality in this population in whom medical follow-up is inherently complicated.

This coastline is c. 10% of the entire coast of Antarctica. From 2000 to 2012, there has been a nearly continuous record of population size of most, and sometimes all, of these colonies. Data were obtained by analysing aerial photographs. We found large annual variations in populations of individual colonies, and conclude that a trend from a single emperor penguin colony may not be a good environmental sentinel. There are at least four possibilities for census count fluctuations: i) this species is not bound to a nesting site like other penguins, and birds move within the colony and possibly to other colonies, ii) harsh environmental conditions cause a die-off of chicks in the colony or of adults elsewhere, iii) the adults skip a year of breeding if pre-breeding foraging is inadequate and iv) if sea ice conditions are unsatisfactory at autumn arrival of the adults, they skip breeding or go elsewhere. Such variability indicates that birds at all Ross Sea colonies should be counted annually if there is to be any possibility of understanding the causes of population changes.","[Kooyman, G.

Methods The French multicentre and retrospective CryoVas survey included 242 patients with non-infectious mixed CryoVas. Causes of death and prognostic factors of survival were assessed and a prognostic score was determined to predict survival at 5 years. Results After a median follow-up of 35 months, 42 patients (17%) died. Causes of death were mainly serious infections (50%) and vasculitis flare (19%). One-, 2-, 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 91%, 89%, 79% and 65%, respectively. A prognostic score, the CryoVas score (CVS), for the prediction of survival at 5 years was devised. Pulmonary and gastrointestinal involvement, glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min and age > 65 years were independently associated with death. At 5 years the death rates were 2.6%, 13.1%, 29.6% and 38.5% for a CVS of 0, 1, 2 and >= 3, respectively. At 1 year the death rates were 0%, 3.2%, 18.5% and 30.8% for a CVS of 0, 1, 2 and >= 3, respectively. The CVS was strongly correlated with the Five Factor Score (FFS) 2009, another prognostic score validated in primary necrotising vasculitis (r=0.82; p < 0.0001). The area under the curve for the CVS was 0.74 compared with 0.67 for the FFS, indicating a better performance of the CVS (p=0.052). Conclusions In patients with non-infectious mixed CryoVas, the main prognostic factors are age > 65 years, pulmonary and gastrointestinal involvement and renal failure. A score including these variables is significantly associated with the prognosis.","[Terrier, Benjamin] Cochin Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Paris, France; [Carrat, Fabrice; Krastinova, Evguenia] Dept Biostat, Paris, France; [Marie, Isabelle] CHU, Dept Internal Med, Rouen, France; [Launay, David] CHU Lille, Dept Internal Med, F-59037 Lille, France; [Lacraz, Adeline] CHU, Dept Nephrol, Bordeaux, France; [Belenotti, Pauline] CHU, Dept Internal Med, Marseille, France; [de Saint Martin, Luc] CHU Brest, Dept Internal Med, Brest, France; [Quemeneur, Thomas] CH, Dept Internal Med, Valenciennes, France; [Huart, Antoine] CHU, Dept Nephrol, Toulouse, France; [Bonnet, Fabrice; Lzaro, Estibaliz] CHU, Dept Internal Med, Bordeaux, France; [Le Guenno, Guillaume] CHU, Dept Internal Med, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Kahn, Jean-Emmanuel] CH, Dept Internal Med, Suresnes, France; [Hinschberger, Olivier] CH, Dept Internal Med, Mulhouse, France; [Rullier, Patricia] CHU Montpellier, Dept Internal Med, Montpellier, France; [Hummel, Aurelie; Plaisier, Emmanuelle] CHU, Dept Nephrol, Paris, France; [Diot, Elisabeth] CHU Tours, Dept Internal Med, Tours, France; [Pagnoux, Christian] CHU, Dept Internal Med, Paris, France; [Bridoux, Frank] CHU, Dept Nephrol, Poitiers, France; [Zenone, Thierry] CH, Dept Internal Med, Valence, France; [Hermine, Olivier] CHU, Dept Hematol, Paris, France; [Leger, Jean-Marc] CHU, Dept Neurol, Paris, France; [Mariette, Xavier] CHU, Dept Neurol, Paris, France; [Senet, Patricia] CHU, Dept Rheumatol, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France; [Cacoub, Patrice] CHU, Dept Dermatol, Paris, France; CHU, Dept Internal Med, Paris, TN USA",,"Cacoub, P (通讯作者)，Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Dept Internal Med, 47-83 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",benjamin.terrier@cch.aphp.fr; patrice.cacoub@psl.aphp.fr,"Hermine, Olivier/Q-7072-2018; Zenone, Thierry/AAR-9451-2020; Pagnoux, Christian/C-4612-2015; Bonnet, Fabrice/T-3254-2019; Launay, David/H-1674-2016; Launay, David/A-5270-2018; KAHN, Jean-Emmanuel/S-8509-2018; Carrat, Fabrice/AAU-8480-2020","Launay, David/0000-0003-1840-1817; Launay, David/0000-0003-1840-1817; KAHN, Jean-Emmanuel/0000-0002-9565-6074; Carrat, Fabrice/0000-0002-8672-7918; Bridoux, Frank/0000-0002-2005-8424; Cacoub, Patrice/0000-0002-6727-4992; de Saint-Martin, Luc/0000-0002-6761-0239; Hermine, Olivier/0000-0003-2574-3874; Belenotti, Pauline/0000-0002-8317-3825",,,,,25,36,37,0,5,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",0003-4967,1468-2060,,ANN RHEUM DIS,Ann.

For this purpose 10 batches of control sera were prepared with titres in the range 0-260 IU per ml. These sera were tested in nine laboratories using immunofluorescence methods; in three laboratories using dye tests; in forty laboratories using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; in four laboratories using direct agglutination and haemagglutination; in seven laboratories using the high-sensitivity IgG agglutination test; and in three laboratories using the latex agglutination test. in this way, 70 series of titrations were carried out using seven procedures and the results were compared with those obtained using the WHO reference serum in 15 cases, with the French national E6 serum in 16 other cases, and in 39 cases using 15 reference sera supplied by the reagent manufacturers. Rigorous comparison of the tests was not possible in all cases because one aim of the study was to ensure that the tests were carried out under the usual working conditions that prevailed in the participating laboratories. The results obtained indicate that the serological tests currently available for toxoplasmosis are acceptable for its serodiagnosis. Presentation of the titres in IU has advantages; however, caution is required since the definition of IU varies according to the test and reagents used. it is therefore essential that the conditions and limits for a positive reaction be carefully defined in each case, especially for commercially available kits.","CTR HOSP UNIV,LAB PARASITOL MYCOL,F-38043 GRENOBLE,FRANCE; CTR HOSP,BIOL LAB,F-95500 GONESSE,FRANCE; SOC FABRICANTS REACT LAB,F-75008 PARIS,FRANCE; HOP LYON,F-69006 LYON,FRANCE",,"Petithory, JC (通讯作者)，CTR HOSP,SERV BIOL,F-95500 GONESSE,FRANCE.",,"Pelloux, Hervé/M-7132-2014","Pelloux, Hervé/0000-0001-5727-5441",,,,,11,14,14,0,1,WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION,GENEVA 27,"DISTRIBUTION AND SALES, CH-1211 GENEVA 27, SWITZERLAND",0042-9686,,,B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN,Bull.

We assessed the correlation between severity of systemic sclerosis (SSc) and current staging systems based on nailfold capillaroscopy. Methods. SCLEROCAP is a multicentre prospective study including consecutive scleroderma patients who have a yearly routine follow-up with capillaroscopy and digital blood pressure measurement. Capillaroscopy images were read by two observers blinded from each other, then by a third one in the case of discordance. A follow-up of 3 years is planned. The present study assessed the correlation between severity of systemic sclerosis (SSc) and current staging systems based on nail fold capillaroscopy at enrollment in the SCLEROCAP study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed for both the Maricq and Cutolo classifications. Results. SCLEROCAP included 387 patients in one year. Maricq's active and Cutolo's late classifications were very similar. In multivariate analysis, the number of digital ulcers (OR for 2 ulcers or more, respectively 2.023 [1.074-3.81] and 2.596 [1.434-4.699]) and Rodnan's skin score >15 (OR respectively 32.007 [6.457-158.658] and 18.390 [5.380-62.865]) correlated with Maricq's active and Cutolo's late stages. Haemoglobin rate correlated with Cutolo's late stage (haemoglobin<100 vs. >120 g/dl: OR 0.223 [0.051-0.980]), and total lung capacity with Maricq's active one: increase in 10%: OR0.833 [0.717-0.969]. Conclusion. The correlations found between capillaroscopy and severity of SSc are promising before the ongoing prospective study definitively assesses whether capillaroscopy staging predicts complications of SSc. Only two capillaroscopic patterns seem useful: one involving many giant capillaries and haemorrhages and the other with severe capillary loss.","[Boulon, C.; Mangin, M.; Skopinski, S.; Constans, J.] Hop St Andre, Serv Med Vasc, 1 Rue Jean Burguet, F-33075 Bordeaux, France; [Aiouaz, S.; Perez, P.] CHU Bordeaux, Unite Soutien Methodol Rech Clin, Pole Sante Publ, Bordeaux, France; [Blaise, S.; Imbert, B.] Hop Univ Grenoble, Dept Med Vasc, Grenoble, France; [Chevoir, J.

We analyzed presentation and outcome of 80 patients with biopsy-proven MCGN, which were identified in the retrospective French CryoVas survey. MCGN was related to primary Sjogren's syndrome in 22.5% of patients and to lymphoproliferative disorders in 28.7% of patients, and was defined as essential in 48.8% of patients. At presentation, hematuria, proteinuria >= 1g/d, hypertension, and renal failure were observed in 97.4%, 84.8%, 85.3%, and 82.3% of cases, respectively. Mean +/- eGFR was 39.5 +/- 20.4 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Membranoproliferative GN was the predominant histologic pattern, observed in 89.6% of cases. Renal interstitium inflammatory infiltrates were observed in 50% of cases. First-line treatment consisted of steroids alone (27.6%) or in association with rituximab (21.1%), alkylating agents (36.8%) or a combination of cyclophosphamide and rituximab (10.5%). After a mean follow-up of 49.9 +/- 45.5 months, 42.7% of patients relapsed with a renal flare in 75% of cases. At last follow-up, mean eGFR was 50.2 +/- 26.1 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) with 9% of patients having reached ESRD; 59% and 50% of patients achieved complete clinical and renal remission, respectively. A rituximab+steroids regimen prevented relapses more effectively than steroids alone or a cyclophosphamide+steroids combination did, but was associated with a higher rate of early death when used as first-line therapy. Severe infections and new-onset B-cell lymphoma occurred in 29.1% and 8.9% of cases, respectively; 24% of patients died. In conclusion, noninfectious MCGN has a poor long-term outcome with severe infections as the main cause of death.","[Zaidan, Mohamad; Hummel, Aurelie] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, Dept Nephrol Transplantat, Paris, France; [Noel, Laure-Helene] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, Dept Pathol, Paris, France; [Hermine, Olivier] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, Dept Adult Hematol, Paris, France; [Zaidan, Mohamad] Inst Necker Enfants Malades, Paris, France; [Zaidan, Mohamad; Terrier, Benjamin] Paris Descartes Univ, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; [Terrier, Benjamin] Cochin Hosp, Natl Referral Ctr Rare Syst Autoimmune Dis, Dept Internal Med, Paris, France; [Pozdzik, Agnieszka] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Erasme Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Brussels, Belgium; [Frouget, Thierry] Univ Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Rennes, France; [Rioux-Leclercq, Nathalie] Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol, Rennes, France; [Combe, Christian] Univ Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Bordeaux, France; [Lepreux, Sebastien] Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol, Bordeaux, France; [Marie, Isabelle] Univ Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Rouen, France; [Legallicier, Bruno] Univ Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Rouen, France; [Francois, Arnaud] Univ Hosp, Dept Pathol, Rouen, France; [Huart, Antoine] Hop Rangueil, Dept Nephrol & Organ Transplant, Toulouse, France; [Launay, David] Univ Med, Lille, France; [Launay, David] Reg Univ Hosp, Dept Internal Med & Clin Immunol, Lille, France; [Launay, David] Natl Referral Ctr Rare Syst Autoimmune Dis Syst S, Lille, France; [Launay, David] Lille Inflammat Res Int Ctr, EA2686, Lille, France; [Kaplanski, Gilles] La Concept Hosp, Dept Clin Immunol & Internal Med, Marseille, France; [Bridoux, Frank] Univ Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Poitiers, France; [Vanhille, Philippe] Univ Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Valenciennes, France; [Makdassi, Raifah] Univ Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Amiens, France; [Augusto, Jean-Francois] Univ Hosp, Dept Nephrol, Dialysis, Transplantat, Angers, France; [Vanhille, Philippe] La Pitie Salpetriere Hosp, AP HP, Dept Pathol, Paris, France; [Leger, Jean-Marc] La Pitie Salpetriere Hosp, AP HP, Dept Nephrol, Paris, France; [Karras, Alexandre] Georges Pompidou European Hosp, AP HP, Dept Nephrol, Paris, France; [Jouanneau, Chantal; Verpont, Marie -Christine] INSERM, Unite Mixte Rech S1155, Paris, France; [Callard, Patrice] Tenon Hosp, AP HP, Dept Pathol, Paris, France; [Senet, Patricia] Tenon Hosp, AP HP, Dept Dermatol, Paris, France; [Ronco, Pierre; Plaisier, Emmanuelle] Tenon Hosp, AP HP, Dept Nephrol & Dialysis, Paris, France; [Carrat, Fabrice] St Antoine Hosp, Dept Publ Hlth, Paris, France; [Carrat, Fabrice] Univ Paris 06, Paris, France; [Carrat, Fabrice] INSERM, U1136, Paris, France; [Mariette, Xavier] Univ Paris 11, Dept Rheumatol, Paris, France; [Mariette, Xavier] Paris Sud, Univ Hosp, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France; [Saadoun, David; Cacoub, Patrice] Grp Hosp Pitie Salpetriere, Dept Internal Med & Clin Immunol, F-75634 Paris, France; [Saadoun, David; Cacoub, Patrice] Inflammat Immunopathol Biotherapy Dept, Paris, France; [Saadoun, David; Cacoub, Patrice] Sorbonne Univ, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Ronco, Pierre; Plaisier, Emmanuelle] Sorbonne Univ, Tenon Hosp, F-75230 Paris 05, France",,"Plaisier, E (通讯作者)，Hop Tenon, Dept Nephrol & Dialysis, 4 Rue Chine, F-75020 Paris, France.",emmanuelle.plaisier@tnn.aphp.fr,"Hermine, Olivier/Q-7072-2018; Launay, David/A-5270-2018; Launay, David/H-1674-2016; Carrat, Fabrice/AAU-8480-2020; SEROR, Raphaele/E-2283-2017; Ronco, Pierre/AAC-8390-2022; Pagnoux, Christian/C-4612-2015; Jean-François, Augusto/L-2887-2015; Matignon, Marie B/Q-8091-2018; Combe, Christian/N-3726-2015; daniel, laurent/R-2826-2016","Launay, David/0000-0003-1840-1817; Launay, David/0000-0003-1840-1817; Carrat, Fabrice/0000-0002-8672-7918; SEROR, Raphaele/0000-0002-5523-1856; Jean-François, Augusto/0000-0003-1498-2132; Cacoub, Patrice/0000-0002-6727-4992; Hermine, Olivier/0000-0003-2574-3874; Bridoux, Frank/0000-0002-2005-8424; de Saint-Martin, Luc/0000-0002-6761-0239; Ly, Kim Heang/0000-0002-8511-903X; Francois, Helene/0000-0001-7436-9554; Combe, Christian/0000-0002-0360-573X; FERLICOT, SOPHIE/0000-0003-4124-9227; daniel, laurent/0000-0002-7539-0109; , nathalie/0000-0002-1555-9021; saadoun, david/0000-0003-3628-9996",,,,,24,23,28,0,7,AMER SOC NEPHROLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1725 I ST, NW STE 510, WASHINGTON, DC 20006 USA",1046-6673,1533-3450,,J AM SOC NEPHROL,J.

A dominant-negative form of heat shock protein (HSP) 110 (HSP110DE9) expressed by cancer cells with MSI, via exon skipping caused by somatic deletions in the T-17 intron repeat, sensitizes the cells to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. We investigated whether HSP110 T-17 could be used to identify patients with colorectal cancer who would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. METHODS: We characterized the interaction between HSP110 and HSP110DE9 using surface plasmon resonance. By using polymerase chain reaction and fragment analysis, we examined how the size of somatic allelic deletions in HSP110 T-17 affected the HSP110 protein expressed by tumor cells. We screened 329 consecutive patients with stage II-III colorectal tumors with MSI who underwent surgical resection at tertiary medical centers for HSP110 T-17. RESULTS: HSP110 and HSP110DE9 interacted in a 1: 1 ratio. Tumor cells with large deletions in T-17 had increased ratios of HSP110DE9: HSP110, owing to the loss of expression of full-length HSP110. Deletions in HSP110 T-17 were mostly biallelic in primary tumor samples with MSI. Patients with stage II-III cancer who received chemotherapy and had large HSP110 T-17 deletions (>= 5 bp; 18 of 77 patients, 23.4%) had longer times of relapse-free survival than patients with small or no deletions (<4 bp; 59 of 77 patients, 76.6%) in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.012-0.8; P = .03). We found a significant interaction between chemotherapy and T-17 deletion (P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: About 25% of patients with stages II-III colorectal tumors with MSI have an excellent response to chemotherapy, due to large, biallelic deletions in the T-17 intron repeat of HSP110 in tumor DNA.","[Collura, Ada; Lagrange, Anais; Svrcek, Magali; Buhard, Olivier; Guilloux, Agathe; Wanherdrick, Kristell; Dorard, Coralie; Taieb, Anna; Saget, Arnaud; Flejou, Jean-Francois; Duval, Alex] INSERM, Ctr Rech St Antoine,Unite Mixte Rech Sci 938, Equipe Instabilite Microsatellites & Canc, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Natl Canc, F-75012 Paris, France; [Collura, Ada; Lagrange, Anais; Svrcek, Magali; Buhard, Olivier; Guilloux, Agathe; Wanherdrick, Kristell; Dorard, Coralie; Taieb, Anna; Saget, Arnaud; Lefevre, Jeremie H.; Parc, Yann; Flejou, Jean-Francois; Duval, Alex] Univ Paris 06, Paris, France; [Svrcek, Magali; Flejou, Jean-Francois] Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Serv Anat & Cytol Pathol, F-75571 Paris, France; [Svrcek, Magali; Flejou, Jean-Francois] Hop Univ Paris Est, Plateforme Microdissect Inst Federatif Rech 65, Paris, France; [Svrcek, Magali; Flejou, Jean-Francois] Hop Univ Paris Est, Tumorotheque, Paris, France; [Marisa, Laetitia] Ligue Natl Canc, Programme Cartes Ident Tumeurs, Paris, France; [Loh, Marie; Soong, Richie] Natl Univ Singapore, Canc Sci Inst Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Zeps, Nikolajs; Platell, Cameron; Mews, Andrew] St John God HealthCare, Bendat Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Subiaco, WA, Australia; [Zeps, Nikolajs; Platell, Cameron; Mews, Andrew; Iacopetta, Barry] Univ Western Australia, Sch Surg, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Platell, Cameron; De Thonel, Aurelie; Seigneuric, Renaud; Marcion, Guillaume] INSERM, Unite Mixte Rech Sci 866, Dijon, France; [Platell, Cameron; De Thonel, Aurelie; Seigneuric, Renaud; Marcion, Guillaume] Univ Burgundy, Dijon, France; [Chapusot, Caroline] Ctr Hosp Univ, Serv Pathol, Dijon, France; [Lepage, Come; Bouvier, Anne-Marie] Burgundy Univ, Dijon Univ Hosp, INSERM U866, Burgundy Canc Registry, Dijon, France; [Gaub, Marie-Pierre] INSERM, U682, Strasbourg, France; [Milano, Gerard] Ctr Antoine Lacassagne, Lab Oncopharmacol, F-06054 Nice, France; [Selves, Janick] Ctr Rech Canc Toulouse, INSERM, U563, Toulouse, France; [Senet, Patrick; Delarue, Patrice] Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR6303, Dijon, France; [Arzouk, Hayat; Lacoste, Claire; Coquelle, Arnaud] Inst Rech Cancerol Montpellier, IRCM, Montpellier, France; [Arzouk, Hayat; Lacoste, Claire; Coquelle, Arnaud] INSERM, U896, Montpellier, France; [Arzouk, Hayat; Lacoste, Claire; Coquelle, Arnaud] Univ Montpellier, F-34059 Montpellier, France; [Arzouk, Hayat; Lacoste, Claire; Coquelle, Arnaud] Inst Reg Canc Montpellier, Montpellier, France; [Bengrine-Lefevre, Leila; Tournigand, Christophe] Univ Paris Est, Hop Henri Mondor, Med Oncol Serv, Creteil, France; [Tournigand, Christophe; Parc, Yann] Hop St Antoine, AP HP, Serv Chirurg Gen & Digest, F-75571 Paris, France; [Biard, Denis S.] CEA, Direct Sci Vivant, Inst Malad Emergentes & Therapies Innovantes, Serv Etud Prions & Infect Atyp, Fontenay Aux Roses, France; [Garrido, Carmen] Anticanc Ctr Georges Francois Leclerc, Dijon, France",,"Duval, A (通讯作者)，INSERM, Ctr Rech St Antoine,UMRS 938, Equipe Instabil Microsatellites & Canc, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Natl Canc, 34 Rue Crozatier, F-75012 Paris, France.",alex.duval@inserm.fr,"Garrido, carmen/G-1633-2018; Garrido, Carolina/GWM-5557-2022; Coralie, Dorard/A-8325-2012; BOUVIER, Anne-Marie/R-6600-2017; Tournigand, Christophe/Q-2831-2018; Lefevre, Jeremie/I-6952-2019; Selves, Janick/M-7719-2014; Guilloux, Agathe/T-2577-2017; Bouvier, Anne-Marie/GLU-3915-2022; Zeps, Nikolajs/AAF-3186-2021; Coquelle, Arnaud/AAE-5425-2020","Garrido, carmen/0000-0003-1368-1493; Lefevre, Jeremie/0000-0001-7601-7464; Bouvier, Anne-Marie/0000-0001-9070-1027; Zeps, Nikolajs/0000-0002-6404-6839; Soong, Richie/0000-0002-0152-1225; Marcion, Guillaume/0000-0002-3634-6316; BIARD, Denis Serge Francois/0000-0001-9697-4392; Milano, Gerard/0000-0003-2478-0040; Collura, Ada/0000-0003-0496-1768; de Thonel, Aurelie/0000-0003-0405-0745; Lacoste, Claire/0000-0001-7013-2533",Carte d'Identite des Tumeurs program from the Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer; Institut National du Cancer; Institut National du Cancer fellowship; Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de le Recherche fellowship,Carte d'Identite des Tumeurs program from the Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer; Institut National du Cancer(Institut National du Cancer (INCA) France); Institut National du Cancer fellowship; Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de le Recherche fellowship,"This work was supported by the Carte d'Identite des Tumeurs program (available: http://cit.ligue-cancer.net) from the Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer and by grants from the Institut National du Cancer (A.

Chemical composition and structure of CUA calcifications have been poorly described. ObjectivesTo describe the localization and morphologic features and determine the precise chemical composition of CUA-related calcium deposits in skin, and identify any mortality-associated factors. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA retrospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted at 7 French hospitals including consecutive adults diagnosed with CUA between January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2017, confirmed according to Hayashi clinical and histologic criteria. Patients with normal renal function were excluded. For comparison, 5 skin samples from patients with arteriolosclerosis and 5 others from the negative margins of skin-carcinoma resection specimens were also analyzed. Main Outcomes and MeasuresLocalization and morphologic features of the CUA-related cutaneous calcium deposits were assessed with optical microscopy and field-emission-scanning electron microscopy, and the chemical compositions of those deposits were evaluated with mu Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and energy dispersive radiographs. ResultsThirty-six patients (median [range] age, 64 [33-89] years; 26 [72%] female) were included, and 29 cutaneous biopsies were analyzed. Calcific uremic arteriolopathy and arteriolosclerosis skin calcifications were composed of pure calcium-phosphate apatite. Calcific uremic arteriolopathy vascular calcifications were always circumferential, found in small to medium-sized vessels, with interstitial deposits in 22 (76%) of the samples. A thrombosis, most often in noncalcified capillary lumens in the superficial dermis, was seen in 5 samples from patients with CUA. Except for calcium deposits, the vessel structure of patients with CUA appeared normal, unlike thickened arteriolosclerotic vessel walls. Twelve (33%) patients died of CUA. Conclusions and RelevanceCalcific uremic arteriolopathy-related skin calcifications were exclusively composed of pure calcium-phosphate apatite, localized circumferentially in small to medium-sized vessels and often associated with interstitial deposits, suggesting its pathogenesis differs from that of arteriolosclerosis. Although the chemical compositions of CUA and arteriolosclerosis calcifications were similar, the vessels' appearances and deposit localizations differed, suggesting different pathogenetic mechanisms.","[Colboc, Hester] Sorbonne Univ, Hop Rothschild, Serv Plaies & Cicatrisat, Paris, France; [Colboc, Hester; Letavernier, Emmanuel] INSERM, Unite Mixte Rech UMR S 51155, Paris, France; [Moguelet, Philippe] Sorbonne Univ, Hop Tenon, Anat & Cytol Pathol, Paris, France; [Bazin, Dominique] Univ Paris XI, Ba340, CNRS, Lab Chim Phys, Orsay, France; [Carvalho, Priscille; Carvalho, Priscilla] CHU Rouen, Serv Dermatol, Rouen, France; [Dillies, Anne-Sophie; Chaby, Guillaume; Lok, Catherine; Moulinier, Christine] CHU Amiens, Serv Dermatol, Amiens, France; [Maillard, Herve; Benton, Nathalie] Ctr Hosp Mans, Serv Dermatol, Le Mans, France; [Kottler, Diane] Hop Bichat Claude Bernard, Serv Dermatol, Paris, France; [Goujon, Elisa] Ctr Hosp Chalon Sur Saone, Serv Dermatol, Chalon Sur Saone, France; [Jurus, Christine; Panaye, Marine] Serv Med Vasc, Clin Tonkin, Villeurbanne, France; [Frochot, Vincent; Daudon, Michel] Sorbonne Univ, Hop Tenon, Serv Explorat Fonct Mukidisciplinaires, Paris, France; [Letavernier, Emmanuel] Sorbonne Univ, Hop Tenon, Serv Explorat Fonct Multidisciplinaires, Paris, France; [Lucas, Ivan] Sorbonne Univ, Unite Mixte Rech UMR 8235, Paris, France; [Weil, Raphael] Univ Paris XI, Lab Phys Solides Ba510, CNRS, Orsay, France; [Courville, Philippe] CHU Rouen, Anat & Cytol Pathol, Rouen, France; [Monfort, Jean-Benoit; Chasset, Francois; Senet, Patricia] Sorbonne Univ, Hop Tenon, Serv Dermatol, Paris, France; [Barete, Stephan] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Serv Dermatol, Paris, France; [Monfort, Jean-Benoit; Senet, Patricia; Baudot, Nathalie; Frances, Camille] Hop Tenon, Serv Dermatol, Paris, France; [Bezier, Maud] Hop St Louis, Serv Dermatol, Paris, France; [Bilan, Paul] Hop Robert Ballanger, Serv Dermatol, Aulnay Sous Bois, France; [Blaise, Sophie; Leccia, Marie-Therese; Villemur, Beatrice] CHU Grenoble, Serv Dermatol, Grenoble, France; [Boye, Thierry] Hop Instruct Annees, Serv Dermatol, Toulon, France; [Colomb, Michel] Polyclin Reims, Serv Dermatol, Bezannes, France; [Combemale, Patrick] Ctr Leon Berard, Serv Dermatol, Lyon, France; [Cuny, Jean-Francois; Schoeffler, Amelie; Truchetet, Francois] Ctr Hosp Reg, Serv Dermatol, Metz, France; [Dereure, Olivier; Guillot, Bernard] CHU Montpellier, Serv Dermatol, Montpellier, France; [Dopmartin, Anne] CHU Caen, Serv Dermatol, Caen, France; [Faivre, Brigitte] CHU Besancon, Serv Dermatol, Besancon, France; [Fontaine, Juliette; Meaume, Sylvie] Hop Rothschild, Serv Plaies & Cicatrisat, Paris, France; [Goujon, Elisa; Joumet, Julie] Ctr Hosp, Serv Dermatol, Chalon Sur Saone, France; [Jacquet, Romain] Med Vasc, Reims, France; [Lazareth, Isabelle] Hop St Joseph, Serv Med Vasc, Paris, France; [LeCerf, Veronique] Dermatol, Paris, France; [Liegon, Anne-Laure] Ctr Hosp, Serv Dermatol, Valence, France; [Mahe, Emmanuel; Tella, Emilie] Ctr Hosp Reg, Serv Dermatol, Argenteuil, France; [Martel, Jacques] Dermatol, Cenon, France; [Modiano, Philippe] Hop St Vincent de Paul, Serv Dermatol, Lille, France; [Perceau, Geraldine] CHU Reims, Serv Dermatol, Reims, France; [Sassolas, Bruno] CHU Brest, Serv Dermatol, Brest, France; [Segard, Magali] CHU Lille, Serv Dermatol, Lille, France; [Schmutz, Jean-Luc] CHU Nancy, Serv Dermatol, Nancy, France; [Toussaint, Pascal] Maison Sante Protestante Bordeaux Bagatelle, Serv Dermatol, Talence, France; [Valliant, Loic] CHU Tours, Serv Dermatol, Tours, France",,"Colboc, H (通讯作者)，Hop Rothschild, AP HP, Serv Plaies & Cicatrisat, 5 Rue Santerre, F-75012 Paris, France.",hester.colboc@aphp.fr,"Blaise, Sophie/AAD-4476-2019; , Bazin/C-6306-2014; LUCAS, Ivan T./S-5742-2016; Blaise, Sophie/AAS-2389-2020","Blaise, Sophie/0000-0001-7238-112X; , Bazin/0000-0002-5112-9061; LUCAS, Ivan T./0000-0001-8930-0437; Blaise, Sophie/0000-0001-7238-112X",,,,,30,17,17,0,4,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",2168-6068,2168-6084,,JAMA DERMATOL,JAMA Dermatol.,JUL,2019.0,155,7,,,,,789,796,,10.1001/jamadermatol.2019.0381,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamadermatol.2019.0381,,,8,Dermatology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Dermatology,IS4MK,31116362.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000482127300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We examined epidemiological characteristics associated with severe disease, then with death. We also compared mortality between patients hospitalised for COVID-19 with and without iRMD. Methods Individuals with suspected iRMD-COVID-19 were included in this French cohort. Logistic regression models adjusted for age and sex were used to estimate adjusted ORs and 95% CIs of severe COVID-19. The most significant clinically relevant factors were analysed by multivariable penalised logistic regression models, using a forward selection method. The death rate of hospitalised patients with iRMD-COVID-19 (moderatesevere) was compared with a subset of patients with non-iRMD-COVID-19 from a French hospital matched for age, sex, and comorbidities. Results Of 694 adults, 438 (63%) developed mild (not hospitalised), 169 (24%) moderate (hospitalised out of the intensive care unit (ICU) and 87 (13%) severe (patients in ICU/deceased) disease. In multivariable imputed analyses, the variables associated with severe infection were age (OR=1.08, 95% CI: 1.05-1.10), female gender (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.25-0.80), body mass index (OR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.12), hypertension (OR=1.86, 95% CI: 1.01-3.42), and use of corticosteroids (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.09-3.54), mycophenolate mofetil (OR=6.6, 95% CI: 1.47-29.62) and rituximab (OR=4.21, 95% CI: 1.61-10.98). Fifty-eight patients died (8% (total) and 23% (hospitalised)). Compared with 175 matched hospitalised patients with non-iRMD-COVID-19, the OR of mortality associated with hospitalised patients with iRMD-COVID-19 was 1.45 (95% CI: 0.87-2.42) (n=175 each group). Conclusions In the French RMD COVID-19 cohort, as already identified in the general population, older age, male gender, obesity, and hypertension were found to be associated with severe COVID-19. Patients with iRMD on corticosteroids, but not methotrexate, or tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 inhibitors, should be considered as more likely to develop severe COVID-19. Unlike common comorbidities such as obesity, and cardiovascular or lung diseases, the risk of death is not significantly increased in patients with iRMD.",,,,eric.hachulla@chru-lille.fr,"Chaigne, Benjamin/AAH-8709-2020; Belot, Alexandre/C-7378-2013; Juge, Pierre-Antoine/AGZ-0658-2022; Collercandy, Nived/AAU-9673-2021; Kone-paut, Isabelle/AAF-6296-2019; LEDOULT, Emmanuel/AAQ-3562-2021; HENTGEN, Véronique/AAR-1348-2021; Trefond, Ludovic/AFQ-4979-2022; Sené, Thomas/AAM-9441-2021","Chaigne, Benjamin/0000-0001-5448-7860; Belot, Alexandre/0000-0003-4902-5332; Collercandy, Nived/0000-0001-7026-2581; PHA, Micheline/0000-0003-3727-2782; VIAL, Guillaume/0000-0003-2437-2370; Langlois, Vincent/0000-0002-4078-6306; Hudry, Christophe/0000-0002-1036-3660; Sordet, Christelle/0000-0001-6382-8735; chatelus, emmanuel/0000-0002-7360-6527; Sobanski, Vincent/0000-0003-3083-2441",le ministere des solidarites et de la sante,le ministere des solidarites et de la sante,This study was not supported by research funding but FAI<SUP>2</SUP>R is funded by le ministere des solidarites et de la sante.,,31,74,78,2,11,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",0003-4967,1468-2060,,ANN RHEUM DIS,Ann.
