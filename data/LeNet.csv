For example, face recognition is susceptible to lighting, makeup, age and distance, and fingerprints are easily forged. Gait recognition is to identify the identity through the walking posture of the person. The gait features are characterized by long-distance, non-contact and non-disguise, which can overcome the defects of face and fingerprint features. However, gait recognition is susceptible to covariates such as clothing, backpacks, and perspectives. In order to reduce the influence of covariates on gait recognition, this paper conducts an in-depth study on gait recognition algorithms. The main contents are as follows: for the residual network model, not only can the network convergence speed be accelerated, but also the recognition rate can be improved. Therefore, the idea of the residual network is combined into the LeNet network model to improve the LeNet network model. Verify the performance of the improved LeNet network model, the improved LeNet network model improved the recognition rate of normal, backpack and coat walking by 0.3%, 0.5%, and 0.8% respectively. Therefore, the improved LeNet network model makes the network converge faster and the recognition rate is improved to some extent.","[Shao, Xiaoqiang; Nie, Xinchao; Zhao, Xuan; Zheng, Runyang; Guo, Defeng] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Elect & Control Engn, Xian, Peoples R China",,"Shao, XQ (corresponding author), Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Elect & Control Engn, Xian, Peoples R China.",1005507659@qq.com; 15621396713@163.com; 1124774458@qq.com; 1173080774@qq.com; 2670314531@qq.com,,,,,,,10,3,3,3,9,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-4390-3,,,,2020.0,,,,,,,1534,1538,,,,,,5,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Engineering,BQ3YM,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000588278500296,0

The following improvements to the traditional LeNet-5 network are made: the convolution and pooling layers are reasonably designed and the size and number of convolution kernels are carefully adjusted to improve fault classification capability; the batch normalization (BN) is adopted after each convolution layer to improve convergence speed; the dropout operation is performed after each full-connection layer except the last layer to enhance generalization ability.

A method was proposed for the detection of hyperthyroidism based on the modified LeNet-5. Three test groups were designed by randomized controlled experiment design for the detection of hyperthyroidism, in which the control group was tested manually by experienced doctors, the LeNet-5 network learning group adopted the classical LeNet-5 network learning algorithm and the experimental group used the modified LeNet-5 network learning algorithm. Evaluation indices included the accuracy, detection efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and F1 score of the detection. At the same time, differences between the two algorithms in the detection of thyroid nodules were compared. There was no significant difference between the 3 groups in the accuracy and specificity of detection of hyperthyroidism. In terms of the detection efficiency and sensitivity, the performance of the network learning algorithm group and learning group was better than that of the control group. Both the network learning algorithm group and experimental group could detect the thyroid nodules accurately, but there was no significant difference in the accuracy of detecting the type of thyroid nodules. The correct rate of malignant thyroid nodules was significantly higher than that of the benign thyroid nodules. The modified LeNet-5 network algorithm showed acceptable consistency with experienced doctors in the detection of hyperthyroidism, and this method was useful for the exclusion of thyroid malignant tumours and can be used as a simple method to exclude and identify malignant thyroid tumours.","Univ Chinese Acad Sci, HwaMei Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, Ningbo 315010, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Q.; Hu, J.

With this method, one-dimensional time domain signal can be transformed into two-dimensional images, which is more suitable for Convolutional Neural Network processing. Meanwhile, the traditional machine learning method has the disadvantage of low robustness and low recognition rate with noise interference. Therefore, based on the feature extraction of Convolution Neural Network, in this paper we proposed an improved LeNet-5 Convolution Neural Network model, that is, adding a convolution layer and a pooling layer to the classic LeNet-5 model. The hidden layer features are extracted by using the trainable convolution kernel, while the extracted implicit features are reduced by the pooling layer, the Softmax classifier is used for classification and recognition of rolling bearing faults.

One contributor key to the performance gain over Advanced Video Coding (AVC) H.264 is the unit partition structure that extended a large number of coding unit shapes (CU) ranging from 64x64 to 8x8 to replace the macroblock structure of H.264/AVC. This pioneering module achieves a significant gap of compression performance at the expense of additional encoding complexity, which increases under HEVC All-intra configuration due to the use of the Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) process. Since I-frame significantly affects the coding efficiency, the main goal of the proposed work is to implement Convolutional Neural Network-based approaches to substitute the brute force RDO search without affecting the compression efficiency performance. LeNet-5-based and AlexNet-based approaches are developed to eliminate extensive computational time used to check all block decision candidates, which deeply optimize the HEVC coding unit partition module for All-intra configuration. In the first step, a database was created for the HEVC intra-mode to learn different models. Subsequently, modified LeNet-5 (M-LeNet-5) and modified AlexNet (M-AlexNet) models are implemented to predict the HEVC CU partition and their performances are compared. Experimental results indicated that the proposed algorithms could speed up the CU partition structure by reducing the intra-mode encoding time up to 85% and 75% with M-LeNet-5 and M-Alex-Net, respectively.","[Imen, Werda; Fatma, Belghith; Masmoudi, Nouri] Univ Sfax, Elect & Informat Technol Lab, Sfax, Tunisia; [Amna, Maraoui] Univ Monastir, Elect & Microelect Lab, Monastir, Tunisia; [Ezahra, Sayadi Fatma] Univ Sousse, Networked Objects Control & Commun Syst, Sousse, Tunisia",,"Imen, W (corresponding author), Univ Sfax, Elect & Informat Technol Lab, Sfax, Tunisia.",imen.phd@gmail.com; amna.maraoui@fsm.rnu.tn; fatmabelghithenis@gmail.com; sayadi_fatma@yahoo.fr; Nouri.masmoudi@enis.mu.tn,"sayadi, fatma/AHC-0214-2022; Werda, Imen/AHB-9833-2022; Maraoui, Amna/AFS-0573-2022","Maraoui, Amna/0000-0002-0448-4378",,,,,25,0,0,5,8,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1863-1703,1863-1711,,SIGNAL IMAGE VIDEO P,Signal Image Video Process.,OCT,2022.0,16,7,,,,,1811,1819,,10.1007/s11760-022-02139-w,0.0,,JAN 2022,9,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,3R1VL,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000748672300002,0

Its accurate detection retains as an open problem, mainly due to the difficulties of low-resolution and arbitrary viewing angles, as well as the limitation of collecting sufficient amount of training samples. Such difficulties have been significantly challenged the design of effective handcraft features as well as robust detectors. In this paper, we tackle these problems by proposing a learn-based feature design and classifier training paradigm. More particularly, a modified LeNet, termed MLeNet, is presented, which modifies the number of units in output layer of LeNet to suit for a specific classification. Meanwhile, MLeNet further increases the number of feature maps with smaller filter size. To further reduce overfitting and improve the performance with a small quantity of training samples, we firstly increase the training dataset by horizontal reflection and then learn MLeNet via combining both pre-training and fine-tuning. We evaluate the proposed model on a real-world masked face detection dataset. Quantitative evaluations over several state-of-the-arts and alternative solution have demonstrated the accuracy and robustness of the proposed model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The precondition of traditional machine learning methods for sensor fault diagnosis is that enough fault data with the same distribution and feature space under the same working environment must exist. Widely used fault diagnosis methods are not suitable for real working environments because they are easily complicated by environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, shock, and vibration. Under the influence of such complex conditions, the acquisition of sensor fault data is limited. In order to improve fault diagnosis accuracy under complex environmental conditions, a novel method of transfer learning (TL) with LeNet-5 is proposed in this paper. Firstly, LeNet-5 is applied to learn the features of the data-rich datasets of gas sensor faults in a normal environment and to adjust the parameters accordingly. The parameters of the LeNet-5 are transferred from the task in the normal environment to a task in a complex environment by using the TL method. Then, the migrated LeNet-5 is used for the fault diagnosis of gas sensors with a small amount of fault data in a complex environment. Finally, a prototype hydrogen sensor array is designed and implemented for experimental verification. The gas sensor fault diagnosis accuracy of the traditional LeNet-5 was 88.48 +/- 1.04%, while the fault diagnosis accuracy of TL with LeNet-5 was 92.49 +/- 1.28%. The experimental results show that the method adopted presents an excellent solution for the fault diagnosis of a hydrogen sensor using a small quantity of fault data obtained under complex environmental conditions.","[Sun, Yongyi; Zhang, Hongquan] Heilongjiang Univ, Coll Heilongjiang Prov, Key Lab Elect Engn, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yongyi; Liu, Shuxia; Yu, Ying; Zhang, Shuang] Liaoning Police Acad, Dept Informat, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Tingting; Zou, Zhihui; Shen, Bin; Zhang, Hongquan] Harbin Engn Univ, Sch Automat, Harbin, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, HQ (corresponding author), Heilongjiang Univ, Coll Heilongjiang Prov, Key Lab Elect Engn, Harbin, Peoples R China.;Zhang, HQ (corresponding author), Harbin Engn Univ, Sch Automat, Harbin, Peoples R China.",1277861501@hrbeu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [62071138]; Key Project of Education Department of Liaoning Province of China [JYT2020LZ01]; Key R&D plan of Liaoning Province of China [2019JH2/10300052]; soft science research project of the Ministry of public security [2020LLYJLNST050]; innovation team support plan of Liaoning Police College of China [JXYJ202007]; Key R&D Projects of department of science and technology of Liaoning Province of China [2020JH2/10300109, [2020] 2Y027]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Project of Education Department of Liaoning Province of China; Key R&D plan of Liaoning Province of China; soft science research project of the Ministry of public security; innovation team support plan of Liaoning Police College of China; Key R&D Projects of department of science and technology of Liaoning Province of China,"This research was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62071138, in part by the Key Project of Education Department of Liaoning Province of China under Grant JYT2020LZ01, in part by the Key R&D plan of Liaoning Province of China under Grant 2019JH2/10300052, in part by the soft science research project of the Ministry of public security under Grant 2020LLYJLNST050, in part by the innovation team support plan of Liaoning Police College of China, in part by the teaching research project of Liaoning Police College of China under Grant JXYJ202007, in part by the Key R&D Projects of department of science and technology of Liaoning Province of China under Grant 2020JH2/10300109 and in part by the science and technology projects of Guizhou Province of China under Grant [2020] 2Y027.",,41,4,4,11,43,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1662-5218,,,FRONT NEUROROBOTICS,Front.

Fashion businesses have used CNN on their e-commerce to solve many problems such as clothes recognition, clothes search and recommendation. A core step for all of these implementations is image classification. However, clothes classification is a challenge task as clothes have many properties, and the depth of clothes categorization is highly complicated. This complicated depth makes different classes to have very similar features, and so the classification problem becomes very hard. In this paper, CNN based LeNet-5 architecture is proposed to train parameters of the CNN on Fashion MNIST dataset. Experimental results show that LeNet-5 model achieved accuracy over 98%. Therefore, it outperforms both the classical CNN model and the other existing state-of-the-art models in literatures.","[Kayed, Mohammed; Anter, Ahmed] Beni Suef Univ, Fac Comp & Artificial Intelligence, Bani Suwayf 62511, Egypt; [Mohamed, Hadeer] Beni Suef Univ, Fac Sci, Bani Suwayf 62511, Egypt",,"Kayed, M (corresponding author), Beni Suef Univ, Fac Comp & Artificial Intelligence, Bani Suwayf 62511, Egypt.",mskayed@gmail.com; sw_anter@yahoo.com; hadeer.mohamed98@ymail.com,"Anter, Ahmed M./O-6250-2014","Anter, Ahmed M./0000-0002-8907-4369",,,,,29,16,16,4,7,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-4800-7,,,,2020.0,,,,,,,238,243,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BS4ME,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000720348300039,0

One key contributor to the performance gain over H.264 is the intra prediction that extended a large number of prediction directions on various sizes of prediction units (PUs), thus at a cost of very high computational complexity. When HEVC has been emerged, several fast Intra prediction and Coding Unit (CU) size decision algorithms are being developed for practical applications. Actually, these two components would cost around 60% to 70% encoding time in the all-intra HEVC encoding. In this paper, a novel CNN-based solution is proposed and evaluated. The main idea is to elect a smallest set of adequate intra directions using our modified LeNet-5 CNN model, thus reduce the computational complexity of (further) rate distortion optimization to a tolerable limit. Besides, two filters are employed: the edge strength extractor in [4] and the early terminated CU partition in [7] to skip most of the unlikely directions and to decrease the number of CUs, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a decrease of up to 66.59% computation with a slightly increase in the bit-rate (1.1% on average) and a little reduction of picture quality (0.109% on average in PSNR) at most.","[Ting, Hai-Che; Fang, Hung-Luen; Wang, Jia-Shung] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hsinchu, Taiwan",,"Ting, HC (corresponding author), Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",ding3639849@gmail.com; a11en504405@gmail.com; jswangtaiwan@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,4,4,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-7884-8,,,,2019.0,,,,,,,20,24,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BO0SD,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000493095400006,0

This method can also be used in the military field to support communication countermeasures via emitter individual identification. In this paper, empirical mode decomposition is carried out for each radar pulse signal, and then the bispectral features are extracted. Dimensionality reduction is carried out according to the symmetry of the bispectral features. The features after dimensionality reduction are input into a one-dimensional LeNet neural network as the fingerprint features of the emitter, and the identification of 10 radar emitter sources is completed.

Simultaneously, different optimizers are used in our method for comparison; the Adam optimizer was found to be the best.

Proper processing of neuro-images can provide differences in brain tissues which may help in diagnosing the disease more effectively. But, due to the complex structures, this is a challenge in differentiating the brain tissues and classifying AD using traditional classification mechanisms. Deep Neural Network (DNN) is a machine learning technique that has the ability to absorb the most important information for classifying an object accurately. LeNet is a popular DNN based model with a simple and effective architecture that also consumes very less implementation time. As like most of the DNN models, LeNet also uses MaxPooling layer for dimensionality reduction by eliminating the information of minimum valued elements. In brain images low intensity valued pixels also may contain very important features. To keep the minimum valued elements too in the network, we have created a separate layer that performs Min-Pooling operation. MinPooling and MaxPooling layers are then concatenated together. Finally, we have replaced all MaxPooling Layers in LeNet by the concatenated layers. We have analysed and compared the performances of modified LeNet model with 20 other most commonly used DNN models, and some of the related works. It is observed that, the modified LeNet model achieved the highest performances.

Cardio vascular disease (CVD) in 2019 records is about 32% of global death rate. Among these deaths, 85% were caused by heart attack and stroke. Atherosclerosis is regarded as a condition at which the arteries become hardened and narrowed due to the plaque accumulation around the walls of arteries. The disease growth is slow, asymptomatic, sudden cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction and stroke. At present, medical diagnostic techniques are widely applied for the prediction of disease. However, they are uncommon in the desired sensitivity and resolution for detection. The lack of non-invasive diagnosing tool for the prediction of disease in early stage limits the treatment and prevention of patients having various degrees.

The diagnosis of SA is traditionally made using Polysomnography (PSG). However, this method requires many electrodes and wires, as well as an expert to monitor the test. Several researchers have proposed instead using a single channel signal for SA diagnosis. Among these options, the ECG signal is one of the most physiologically relevant signals of SA occurrence, and one that can be easily recorded using a wearable device. However, existing ECG signal-based methods mainly use features (i.e. frequency domain, time domain, and other nonlinear features) acquired from ECG and its derived signals in order to construct the model. This requires researchers to have rich experience in ECG, which is not common. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a kind of deep neural network that can automatically learn effective feature representation from training data and has been successfully applied in many fields. Meanwhile, most studies have not considered the impact of adjacent segments on SA detection. Therefore, in this study, we propose a modified LeNet-5 convolutional neural network with adjacent segments for SA detection. Our experimental results show that our proposed method is useful for SA detection, and achieves better or comparable results when compared with traditional machine learning methods.","[Wang, Tao; Lu, Changhua; Shen, Guohao; Hong, Feng] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Lu, Changhua] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Software, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China",,"Wang, T (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",wtustc@mail.ustc.edu.cn,,"Wang, Tao/0000-0002-2926-3977",Special-funded Program on National Key Scientific Instruments and Equipment Development of China [2013YQ220643]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71331002],Special-funded Program on National Key Scientific Instruments and Equipment Development of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The work is supported by the Special-funded Program on National Key Scientific Instruments and Equipment Development of China under grant No. 2013YQ220643, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No. 71331002.

A standard benchmarking dataset is not available for HDCR that helps to develop deep learning models. To progress the performance of HDCR, in this study, we produced a dataset of 38,750 images of Devanagari numerals, and vowels are generated and made publicly available for fellow researchers in this domain. This data is collected from more than 3000 subjects of different age groups. Each character is extracted by a segmentation technique proposed here, which is limited to this application. Experiments are conducted on the dataset; three different Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) architecture is developed. 1. CNN, 2. Modified Lenet CNN (MLCNN) and 3. Alexnet CNN (ACNN). A Modified LCNN is proposed by changing the architecture of Lenet 5 CNN. Regular Lenet 5 has tanh(x) as its activation function. Since the Devangari characters are nonlinear, non-linearity is introduced in the Networks by using Rectified Linear Unit. This solves the problem of vanishing gradient problem by tanh(x). We achieved a recognition rate of 96% on training data and 94% on unseen data using CNN. MLCNN obtained an accuracy rate of 99% and 94% with less computational cost. Whereas, ACNN attained a recognition rate of 99% and 98% on unseen data. A series of experiments were conducted on the data with different combination splits of data and found a minimum loss of 0.001%. Such developments fill a significant percentage of the huge gap between real-world requirements and the actual performance of Devanagari recognizers.","[Prashanth, Duddela Sai; Mehta, R.

Its stable operation will directly affect the safety and reliability of the whole equipment. It is very significant to realize its health status monitoring and intelligent fault diagnosis. In view of the restrictions of traditional mechanical fault diagnosis in the dependence on a large number of signal processing technologies and expert diagnosis experience, as well as the time-consuming of data preprocessing, it is very meaningful to explore new ideas and methods to realize intelligent fault diagnosis of hydraulic piston pump. Based on the standard LeNet-5 model, the kernel size and kernel number are improved, and the batch normalization layers are added to the network architecture. Based on the Improve-LeNet-5 model, the recognition accuracy is chosen as the target value of the fitness function, the hyperparameters of the Improve-LeNet-5 model are automatically optimized via particle swarm optimization (PSO), including the learning rate, the number of convolution kernels, batch size, and the number of neurons in the fully connected layer. Finally, the PSO-Improve-CNN diagnostic model is constructed. And it is employed to classify and identify five signals data of hydraulic piston pump: normal state, swash plate wear, sliding slipper wear, loose slipper and center spring failure. Research result indicates that the recognition accuracy of PSO-Improve-CNN model can reach 98.71%, and the highest recognition accuracy can reach 99.06%, which are respectively higher than the standard LeNet- 5 and Improve-LeNet-5 about 5.23% and 2.25%. By comparing with AlexNet, VGG11, VGG13, VGG16, and GoogleNet, the PSO-Improve-CNN model presents the highest diagnostic accuracy, less time in training and testing, and greater robustness. The comprehensive performance of the proposed model is demonstrated to be much stronger.

Researchers have exploited the techniques of machine learning, deep learning, and image processing to carry out their research successfully. The new and recent research on road sign classification and recognition systems is the result of the use of deep learning-based architectures such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures.

From the perspective of uncertainty, we demonstrate that the Min-Max property corresponds to minimizing the fuzziness of the model parameters through a simplified formulation of convolution. It is experimentally confirmed that the model with the Min-Max property has a stronger adversarial robustness, thus this property can be incorporated into the design of loss function.

Unfortunately, Computation of CNN is both memory-intensive and computation-intensive, which brings a huge challenge to the design of the hardware accelerators. A large number of hardware accelerators for CNN inference are designed by the industry and the academia. Most of the engines are based on 32-bit floating point matrix multiplication, where the data precision is over-provisioned for inference job and the hardware cost are too high. In this paper, a 8-bit fixed-point LeNet inference engine (Laius) is designed and implemented on FPGA. In order to reduce the consumption of FPGA resource, we proposed a methodology to find the optimal bit-length for weight and bias in LeNet, which results in using 8-bit fixed point for most of the computation and using 16-bit fixed point for other computation. The PE (Processing Element) design is proposed. Pipelining and PE tiling technique is use to improve the performance of the inference engine. By theoretical analysis, we came to the conclusion that DSP resource in FPGA is the most critical resource, it should be carefully used during the design process. We implement the inference engine on Xilinx 485t FPGA. Experiment result shows that the designed LeNet inference engine can achieve 44.9 Gops throughput with 8-bit fixed-point operation after pipelining. Moreover, with only 1% loss of accuracy, the 8-bit fixed-point engine largely reduce 31.43% in latency, 87.01% in LUT consumption, 66.50% in BRAM consumption, 65.11% in DSP consumption and 47.95% reduction in power compared to a 32-bit fixed-point inference engine with the same structure.","[Li, Zhisheng; Wang, Lei; Guo, Shasha; Deng, Yu; Dou, Qiang; Zhou, Haifang] Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Lu, Wenyuan] Xian Satellite Monitoring & Control Ctr, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Li, ZS (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",lizhsh_123@163.com,,,"NSFC [61402501, 61472432]",NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This project was supported by NSFC 61402501 and 61472432.

Recent deep learning models overcome these problems by implicitly capturing intricate structures from large-scale medical image data. However, they are still affected by network hyperparameters and topology. Hence, the state of the art in this area can be further optimized by integrating bio-inspired concepts into deep learning models. This work proposes a novel bio-inspired deep learning approach for optimizing predictive results of liver cancer. This approach contributes to the literature in two ways. Firstly, a novel hybrid segmentation algorithm is proposed to extract liver lesions from computed tomography (CT) images using SegNet network, UNet network, and artificial bee colony optimization (ABC), namely, SegNet-UNet-ABC. This algorithm uses the SegNet for separating liver from the abdominal CT scan, then the UNet is used to extract lesions from the liver. In parallel, the ABC algorithm is hybridized with each network to tune its hyperparameters, as they highly affect the segmentation performance. Secondly, a hybrid algorithm of the LeNet-5 model and ABC algorithm, namely, LeNet-5/ABC, is proposed as feature extractor and classifier of liver lesions. The LeNet-5/ABC algorithm uses the ABC to select the optimal topology for constructing the LeNet-5 network, as network structure affects learning time and classification accuracy. For assessing performance of the two proposed algorithms, comparisons have been made to the state-of-the-art algorithms on liver lesion segmentation and classification. The results reveal that the SegNet-UNet-ABC is superior to other compared algorithms regarding Jaccard index, Dice index, correlation coefficient, and convergence time. Moreover, the LeNet-5/ABC algorithm outperforms other algorithms regarding specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and computational time.","[Ghoniem, Rania M.] Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Dept Informat Technol, Riyadh 84428, Saudi Arabia; [Ghoniem, Rania M.] Mansoura Univ, Dept Comp, Mansoura 35516, Egypt",,"Ghoniem, RM (corresponding author), Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Dept Informat Technol, Riyadh 84428, Saudi Arabia.;Ghoniem, RM (corresponding author), Mansoura Univ, Dept Comp, Mansoura 35516, Egypt.",RMGhoniem@pnu.edu.sa,,,Deanship of Scientific Research at Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University through the Fast-track Research Funding Program,Deanship of Scientific Research at Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University through the Fast-track Research Funding Program(Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University),This research was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research at Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University through the Fast-track Research Funding Program.,,72,17,17,1,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2078-2489,,INFORMATION,Information,FEB,2020.0,11,2,,,,,,,80,10.3390/info11020080,0.0,,,36,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,KU2MK,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000519542400047,0

Various languages like Urdu, English, Chinese, and Japanese have OCR applications, but very little work has been conducted on the Pashto language in this perspective. It becomes more difficult for OCR applications to recognize handwritten characters and digits, because handwriting is influenced by the writer's hand dynamics. Moreover, there was no publicly available dataset for handwritten Pashto digits before this study. Due to this, there was no work performed on the recognition of Pashto handwritten digits and characters combined. To achieve this objective, a dataset of Pashto handwritten digits consisting of 60,000 images was created. The trio deep learning Convolutional Neural Network, i.e., CNN, LeNet, and Deep CNN were trained and tested with both Pashto handwritten characters and digits datasets. From the simulations, the Deep CNN achieved 99.42 percent accuracy for Pashto handwritten digits, 99.17 percent accuracy for handwritten characters, and 70.65 percent accuracy for combined digits and characters. Similarly, LeNet and CNN models achieved slightly less accuracies (LeNet; 98.82, 99.15, and 69.82 percent and CNN; 98.30, 98.74, and 66.53 percent) for Pashto handwritten digits, Pashto characters, and the combined Pashto digits and characters recognition datasets, respectively.

Many empirical schemes such as the Holdridge life zone (HLZ) system have been proposed and implemented to predict the global distribution of terrestrial biomes. Knowledge of physiological climatic limits has been employed to predict biomes, resulting in more precise simulation; however, this requires different sets of physiological limits for different vegetation classification schemes. Here, we demonstrate an accurate and practical method to construct empirical models for biome mapping: a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained by an observation-based biome map, as well as images depicting air temperature and precipitation. Unlike previous approaches, which require assumption(s) of environmental constrain for each biome, this method automatically extracts non-linear seasonal patterns of climatic variables that are relevant in biome classification. The trained model accurately simulated a global map of current terrestrial biome distribution. Then, the trained model was applied to climate scenarios toward the end of the 21st century, predicting a significant shift in global biome distribution with rapid warming trends. Our results demonstrate that the proposed CNN approach can provide an efficient and objective method to generate preliminary estimations of the impact of climate change on biome distribution. Moreover, we anticipate that our approach could provide a basis for more general implementations to build empirical models of other climate-driven categorical phenomena.","[Sato, Hisashi] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Res Inst Global Change RIGC, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Ise, Takeshi] Kyoto Univ, Field Sci Educ & Res Ctr FSERC, Kyoto 6068502, Japan",,"Sato, H (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Res Inst Global Change RIGC, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan.",hsatoscb@gmail.com,,"Sato, Hisashi/0000-0002-6510-4914","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [18H03357, 17H01477]; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II (ArCS II) [JPMXD1420318865]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Arctic Challenge for Sustainability II (ArCS II)","Anonymous reviewers and Tobias Gerken provided valuable comments on previous versions of the paper.

However, the question of how to get a higher accuracy just by learning from the dataset of the images of lymphatic node sections has not been paid attention to. This paper aims to solve this problem by applying a convolutional neural network (CNN), which has nine convolution layers, four dropout layers, three maxpooling layers, two dense layers, and one flatten layer in total. Experiments on the PatchCamelyon dataset show that our method can handle the Lymphoma cancer diagnosis problem with an accuracy of 93.15%, much higher than that of the LeNet and AlexNet, which are 83.17% and 84.49%, respectively.

One of the most influential new tools is code the tree unit (CTU) partition structure. In the HEVC standard, a CTU becomes a block-shaped region replacing a macroblock based on H.264/AVC. This module achieves a significant gap of compression performance at the expense of encoding complexity increases under All-intra configuration. Block unit structure can be split into nested coding units (CUs) (range sizes 64x64 to 8x8) after applying the Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) process which becomes a bottleneck for feasible implementation. To resolve this issue, we suggest substituting the brute force RDO search with a LeNet-5 model for a CU partition at intra-mode. First, we created a database for the HEVC intra-mode in order to learn the learning model. Subsequently, a LeNet5 model is proposed for predicting the HEVC CU partition. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can speed up the CU partition structure by reducing the intra-mode encoding time by an average of 87.47% while degrading by 3.64% the compression performance. Our CU decision scheme outperforms all state-of-the-art solutions in terms of complexity reductions.","[Amna, Maraoui; Ezahra, Sayadi Fatma] Univ Monastir, Elect & Microelect Lab, Monastir, Tunisia; [Imen, Werda] Univ Sfax, Elect & Informat Technol Lab, Sfax, Tunisia",,"Amna, M (corresponding author), Univ Monastir, Elect & Microelect Lab, Monastir, Tunisia.",amna.maraoui@fsm.mu.tn; imen.phd@gmail.com; sayadi_fatma@yahoo.fr,,"Maraoui, Amna/0000-0002-0448-4378",,,,,17,4,4,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-7668-0,,,,2021.0,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/ISIVC49222.2021.9487529,0.0,,,4,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Telecommunications,BT7HL,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000848630900001,0

The power of DNNs is now available at the edge in a compact and power-efficient form factor with the aid of hardware acceleration. In this paper, we introduce an architecture that uses a generalized method called Single Partial Product 2-Dimensional Convolution (SPP2D Convolution) which calculates a 2-D convolution in a fast and expedient manner. We demonstrate that the SPP2D architecture prevents the re-fetching of input weights for the calculation of partial products, and it can calculate the output of any input size and kernel with low latency and high throughput compared to other popular techniques. SPP2D based architecture can reduce the memory access and execution time related to input reuse by at least three times in comparison with the work done in Ardakani et al. (2018) and approximately nine times that of the standard sliding window approach. We have implemented the generalized SPP2D architecture on the Xilinx KC705 Kintex-7 evaluation board to illustrate that the new SPP2D algorithm is well-suited for the hardware acceleration of DNNs. We implemented LeNet-5 and VGGNet-16 using the SPP2D architecture. We demonstrate that the SPP2D based LeNet-5 has a high throughput of 5 GOP/s and 14.8 GOP/s/W and 42 GOP/s/W for the convolution operation using the SPP2D IP. Our LeNet-5 design achieves a similar throughput to Zhou and Jiang (2015) however using 3.3x fewer DSPs and an even smaller memory and lookup table (LUT) footprint. The SPP2D based VGGNet-16 network has a latency of 91.3 ms which is 79%, 97%, 17% and 95% less than contemporary designs respectively, while running at a low power of 298 mW which is similar to the power level of these designs. The total processing time of our design with a parallelism factor of nine is 3.93 secs and it is 70% less than that in Ardakani et al. (2018) and 24% less than that in Panchbhaiyye and Ogunfunmi (2021). The SPP2D based LeNet-5 and VGGNet-16 accelerators provide a low-latency design with reduced memory access thus leading to a low-power design. As a result, SPP2D convolution is very well suited for hardware acceleration of DNNs.","[Ansari, Anaam; Ogunfunmi, Tokunbo] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",,"Ogunfunmi, T (corresponding author), Santa Clara Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",togunfunmi@scu.edu,,"Ansari, Anaam/0000-0002-4081-1225; Ogunfunmi, Tokunbo/0000-0003-3517-9779","School of Engineering, Santa Clara University, Dean Excellence in Research Award","School of Engineering, Santa Clara University, Dean Excellence in Research Award","This work was supported by the School of Engineering, Santa Clara University, Dean Excellence in Research Award.",,49,0,0,2,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022.0,10,,,,,,16843,16858,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3149505,0.0,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,ZB0DK,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000756523400001,0

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid algorithm that aims to tackle the disadvantage mentioned above by combining the advantages of the Lclose Particle Swarm Optimization (LPSO) and SGD algorithm. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a Global optimization algorithm, but it does not perform very well in optimizing the loss function of the neural network because of the neural network's high dimensional weight parameters and the infinite search area.

Due to the tremor effects on the hands, drawing a spiral shape in particular becomes difficult for those with Parkinson's. In this work, we have considered this as the primary criteria for our diagnosis system.

The combination of LeNet and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model is used for the classification of heamoprotazoan samples into three classes such as theileriosis, babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Also, BreaKHis dataset image samples are classified into two major classes as malignant and benign. The hyperparameter optimization is used for selecting the prominent features. The main objective of this approach is to overcome the manual identification and classification of samples into different haemoprotozoan diseases in cattle. The traditional laboratory approach of identification is time-consuming and requires human expertise. The proposed methodology will help to identify and classify the heamoprotozoan disease in early stage without much of human involvement. Design/methodology/approach LeNet-based Bi-LSTM model is used for the classification of pathology images into babesiosis, anaplasmosis, theileriosis and breast images classified into malignant or benign. An optimization-based super pixel clustering algorithm is used for segmentation once the normalization of histopathology images is conducted. The edge information in the normalized images is considered for identifying the irregular shape regions of images, which are structurally meaningful. Also, it is compared with another segmentation approach circular Hough Transform (CHT). The CHT is used to separate the nuclei from non-nuclei. The Canny edge detection and gaussian filter is used for extracting the edges before sending to CHT. Findings The existing methods such as artificial neural network (ANN), convolution neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), LSTM and Bi-LSTM model have been compared with the proposed hyperparameter optimization approach with LeNET and Bi-LSTM. The results obtained by the proposed hyperparameter optimization-Bi-LSTM model showed the accuracy of 98.99% when compared to existing models like Ensemble of Deep Learning Models of 95.29% and Modified ReliefF Algorithm of 95.94%. Originality/value In contrast to earlier research done using Modified ReliefF, the suggested LeNet with Bi-LSTM model, there is an improvement in accuracy, precision and F-score significantly. The real time data set is used for the heamoprotozoan disease samples. Also, for anaplasmosis and babesiosis, the second set of datasets were used which are coloured datasets obtained by adding a chemical acetone and stain.","[Reddy, Shiva Sumanth] Dayananda Sagar Acad Technol & Management, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Nandini, C.] Dayananda Sagar Acad Technol & Management, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",,"Reddy, SS (corresponding author), Dayananda Sagar Acad Technol & Management, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",sumanthdsatm@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-378X,1756-3798,,INT J INTELL COMPUT,Int.

The expansion of power systems including transmission lines with various lengths have made the fault detection, classification, and location estimation process more challenging. Transmission line datasets are stream data which are continuously collected by various sensors and hence, require generalized and fast fault diagnosis approaches. Newly collected datasets including voltages and currents for faulty and non-faulty situations might not have adequate and accurate labels that are useful to train neural networks. In this paper, a novel transfer learning framework based on a pre-trained LeNet-5 convolutional neural network is proposed. This method is able to diagnose faults for different transmission line lengths and impedances by transferring the knowledge from a source convolutional neural network to predict a dissimilar target dataset. By transferring this knowledge, faults from various transmission lines, even without sufficient data samples with labels, can be diagnosed faster and more efficiently than the existing methods. To prove the feasibility and effectiveness of this methodology, seven different datasets that include various lengths of transmission lines are used. The robustness of the proposed methodology against the generator voltage fluctuations, variations in fault locations, fault inception angle, fault resistance, and phase difference between the two generators are well studied to prove the reliability of this technique for fault diagnosis of transmission lines.

Also, the migration learning and convolutional neural network are used to construct a K-selection migration learning algorithm and a migration framework model whose parameters are migrated to the image data set. The use of a label data set with a large sample size, the selection of a pre-trained convolutional neural network model with a deep layer of complex network structure and the selection of an appropriate network fine-tuning depth can optimize the migration adaptation effect of the migration network.

Melanoma comes from melanocyte cells, melanin-producing cells, so that melanomas are generally brown or black coloured. Melanomas are mostly caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation that damages the DNA of skin cells. The diagnoses of melanoma cancer are often performed manually by using visuals of the skilled doctors, analyzing the result of dermoscopy examination and match it with medical sciences. Manual detection weakness is highly influenced by human subjectivity that makes it inconsistent in certain conditions. Therefore, a computer assisted technology is needed to help classifying the results of dermoscopy examination and to deduce the results more accurately with a relatively faster time. The making of this application starts with problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing. This application uses deep learning technology with Convolutional Neural Network method and LeNet-5 architecture for classifying image data. The experiment using 44 images data from the training results with a different number of training and epoch resulted the highest percentage of success at 93% in training and 100% in testing, which the number of training data used of 176 images and 100 epochs.

Thus, this paper proposes IVGG13 (Improved Visual Geometry Group-13), a modified VGG16 model for classification pneumonia X-rays images. Open-source thoracic X-ray images acquired from the Kaggle platform were employed for pneumonia recognition, but only a few data were obtained, and datasets were unbalanced after classification, either of which can result in extremely poor recognition from trained neural network models. Therefore, we applied augmentation pre-processing to compensate for low data volume and poorly balanced datasets. The original datasets without data augmentation were trained using the proposed and some well-known convolutional neural networks, such as LeNet AlexNet, GoogLeNet and VGG16. In the experimental results, the recognition rates and other evaluation criteria, such as precision, recall and f-measure, were evaluated for each model. This process was repeated for augmented and balanced datasets, with greatly improved metrics such as precision, recall and F1-measure. The proposed IVGG13 model produced superior outcomes with the F1-measure compared with the current best practice convolutional neural networks for medical image recognition, confirming data augmentation effectively improved model accuracy.","[Jiang, Zhi-Peng; Liu, Yi-Yang; Shao, Zhen-En; Huang, Ko-Wei] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan; [Jiang, Zhi-Peng] Kaohsiung Vet Gen Hosp, Dept Informat Management, Kaohsiung 813, Taiwan; [Liu, Yi-Yang] Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Urol, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan; [Liu, Yi-Yang] Chang Gung Univ, Coll Med, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan",,"Huang, KW (corresponding author), Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.",109154106@nkust.edu.tw; I108154101@nkust.edu.tw; kotori22339@gmail.com; elone.huang@nkust.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.

The architecture of deep neural networks is inspired by the hierarchical structure of the brain. Deep neural networks feature a hierarchical, layer-wise arrangement of nonlinear activation functions (neurons) fed by inputs scaled by linear weights (synapses). Deep Learning frameworks simplify model development and training by providing high-level primitives for complex and error-prone mathematical transformations, like gradient descent, back-propagation, and inference. The main goal of this study is to compare the performance of two trending frameworks, Caffe and TensorFlow for Deep Machine Learning. As benchmark for the comparison with other approaches in deep learning was a well-analyzed database for handwritten cipher classification chosen. These two frameworks (Caffe and TensorFlow) were chosen out of nine different frameworks, after checking which ones better fits the proposed selection criteria. Caffe and TensorFlow frameworks were selected after nine different frameworks were analyzed using the following selection criteria: programming language, functionality level, algorithms and network architecture, pre-trained models and community activity. As the performance is heavily affected by the number of parameters in the networks, four well-known convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG19 and GoogLeNet) were trained and tested using both frameworks. Using architectures with different deepness will allow investigating how the number of hidden layers improves the accuracy of the CNN. As a CNN requires high computational effort, two computers equipped with different NVIDIA GPU were used to ease the effort and they were used to investigate how the hardware improves the performance of the CNN and if it is worthy to invest on it. As the CNN are widely used for image classification, it was defined that the used architecture was going to be used for classification of handwritten numbers, because this example of classification is very well analyzed and can serve as a benchmark for comparison. Due to this and considering that the training of these networks requires a huge amount of data, MNIST database was set for training and testing them. All the architectures were adapted to the3 MNIST database and they were developed for Caffe and TensorFlow frameworks and analyzed on the named architectures. The biggest differences on our hardware we have got in training the VVG19 and the GoogLeNet architectures in TensorFlow and Caffe.","[Pester, Andreas; Madritsch, Christian; Klinger, Thomas; de Guerena, Xabier Lopez] Carinthia Univ Appl Sci, Europastr 4, Villach, Austria",,"Pester, A (corresponding author), Carinthia Univ Appl Sci, Europastr 4, Villach, Austria.",pester@fh-kaernten.at,"; Pester, Andreas/P-4479-2017","Klinger, Thomas/0000-0002-9133-553X; Pester, Andreas/0000-0001-7278-7349",,,,,19,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2367-3370,2367-3389,978-3-030-23162-0; 978-3-030-23161-3,LECT NOTE NETW SYST,,,2020.0,80,,,,,,817,831,,10.1007/978-3-030-23162-0_74,0.0,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BT0EC,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000786714700074,0

Combined with the abundant information of bubbles in the light field images, a fast and accurate 3D reconstruction method for dilute bubbly flow based on the deep learning algorithm DIF-LeNet (Double Information Fusion with LeNet5 net) is proposed in this work. The calibration method and bubble segmentation algorithm of light field image for data processing is detailed. DIF-LeNet realizes the fusion of different dimension data and regression prediction. By DIF-LeNet, bubble depth could be predicted by fusing the refocused bubble image with the focal distance of the refocused image. Then, the three-dimensional bubble field could be reconstructed with the bubble depth, bubble center and bubble diameter. Comparing with the reconstruction method based on statistics and LeNet5, the reconstruction accuracy and speed of the proposed method based on DIF-LeNet are improved. Especially for the bubble without focused image in the refocused image sequence, the effect of 3D reconstruction based on DIF-LeNet is much prominent.","[Wang, Hongyi; Wang, Hongyu; Zhu, Xinjun; Song, Limei] Tiangong Univ, Key Lab Adv Elect Engn & Energy Technol, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China; [Guo, Qinghua] Univ Wollongong, Sch Elect Comp & Telecommun Engn, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Dong, Feng] Tianjin Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Proc Measurement & Control, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",,"Song, LM (corresponding author), Tiangong Univ, Key Lab Adv Elect Engn & Energy Technol, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China.",wanghongyi@tiangong.edu.cn; 1119513376@qq.com; xinjunzhu@tiangong.edu.cn; songlimei@tiangong.edu.cn; qguo@uow.edu.au; fdong@tju.edu.cn,"Guo, Q/N-2963-2018; Dong, Feng/H-6420-2011","Guo, Q/0000-0002-5180-7854; Dong, Feng/0000-0002-8478-8928","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51806150]; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin [18JCQNJC04400, 18JCQNJC71100]; Research Project of Tianjin Municipal Education Committee [2019KJ020]; Program for Innovative Research Team in University of Tianjin [TD13-5036]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin(Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin); Research Project of Tianjin Municipal Education Committee; Program for Innovative Research Team in University of Tianjin,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 51806150, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin under Grant 18JCQNJC04400 and Grant 18JCQNJC71100, in part by The Research Project of Tianjin Municipal Education Committee under Grant 2019KJ020, and in part by the Program for Innovative Research Team in University of Tianjin under Grant TD13-5036.

To break the dissemination barriers encountered by traditional media, this work probes into the dissemination effect of human-computer interactive advertising news. An in-depth analysis of the current dissemination situation of interactive online advertising (IOA) is firstly conducted, and then the methods to effectively guide and manage audience emotions are studied. Finally, an improved LeNet-5 model is established to identify audience emotions. The improvement of the LeNet-5 model in this work is composed of the following four points. (1) The convolution module sets Inception_conv3 and Inception_conv5 are adopted to replace the third convolutional layer Conv3 and the fifth layer Conv5 of the LeNet-5, respectively. (2) The size of the convolution kernel is changed. The original convolution kernel is replaced by two 3 x 3 convolution kernels in the Inception_conv3 and Inception_conv5 module sets. (3) The number of convolution kernels is reasonably changed. (4) The Batch Normalization (BN) layer is used. The experimental results show that interactive advertisements have the better dissemination effects among the audiences with older age, higher education, and in more developed cities. The improved LeNet-5 network can effectively solve the over-fitting and gradient disappearance, with a good robustness. The recognition rate reaches more than 81%, which is higher than the traditional LeNet-5 network by 3%. It can be known that the accuracy of the improved LeNet-5 network image recognition is significantly promoted. This research provides a certain reference for the optimization of news dissemination.","[Xu, Zhu] Nanjing Normal Univ, Zhongbei Coll, Dept Humanities, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chuanbin] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Nanjing, Peoples R China",,"Xu, Z (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Zhongbei Coll, Dept Humanities, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China.",4685199@nnudy.edu.cn,,,,,,,26,0,0,8,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

In this paper, we propose a two-step framework (namely, group scissor) to scale NCS designs to large neural networks. The first step rank clipping integrates low-rank approximation into the training to reduce total crossbar area. The second step is group connection deletion, which structurally prunes connections to reduce routing congestion between crossbars. Tested on convolutional neural networks of LeNet on MNIST database and ConvNet on CIFAR-10 database, our experiments show significant reduction of crossbar and routing area in NCS designs. Without accuracy loss, rank clipping reduces the total crossbar area to 13.62% or 51.81% in the NCS design of LeNet or ConvNet, respectively.

Three innovations are proposed: (1) The network inherits the size of LeNet's convolution kernel and deepens the depth of the network, and can learn more features; (2) The weighted cross entropy loss, which is used for the sample class imbalance problem; (3) a dynamic learning rate based on the rate of change of loss, which is used to deal with overfitting and underfitting. Finally, the experiments in the DIARETDB1 and E-ophtha databases show that the improved LeNet convolutional neural network has achieved good results in the detection of background retinal image lesions.","[Fan, Xiao-nan; Gong, Jun; Yan, Yao] Northeastern Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China",,"Fan, XN (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China.",fanxiaonanneu@126.com,,,National Nature Science Fund of Northeastern University [61773104],National Nature Science Fund of Northeastern University,This work is supported by National Nature Science Fund of Northeastern University under No.61773104.,,9,0,0,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1948-9439,,978-1-7281-0105-7,CHIN CONT DECIS CONF,,,2019.0,,,,,,,5661,5666,,,,,,6,Automation & Control Systems; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Operations Research & Management Science,BP5JZ,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000555859005162,0

The health status of a pump is important for the safety and reliability of the mechanical equipment. Hence, it is necessary to develop intelligent fault diagnosis for a hydraulic piston pump. In this research, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is introduced to automatically select the hyperparameters of diagnosis model. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model optimized by PSO is constructed based on the standard LeNet. The PSO-LeNet model is applied to identify five common states of a hydraulic piston pump using an acoustic signal: normal state, swash plate wear, center spring failure, loose slipper, and slipper wear. Many typical deeper CNN models are compared and used for the verification of the performance of the proposed model, such as AlexNet, VGG11, VGG13, VGG16, and GoogleNet. Results indicate that the PSO-LeNet has the best stability and the highest identification accuracy. Thus, the proposed model has the laudable overall performance.

DL testing structure only depends on the data labeling and manual group. Nowadays, a lot of coverage criteria have been developed, but these criteria basically count the neurons' quantity whose activation during the implementation of a DL structure fulfilled certain properties. Also, existing criteria are not adequately fine-grained to capture delicate behaviors. This paper develops an optimized deep belief network (DBN) with a search and rescue (SAR) algorithm for testing coverage criteria. For an optimal selection of DBN structure, the SAR algorithm is introduced. The main objective is to test the DL structure using different criteria to enhance the coverage accuracy. The different coverage criteria such as KMNC, NBC, SNAC, TKNC, and TKNP are used for the testing of DBN. Using the generated test inputs, the criteria is validated and the developed criteria are capable to capture undesired behaviors in the DBN structure. The developed approach is implemented by Python platform using three standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. For analysis, the developed approach is compared with the three LeNet models like LeNet-1, LeNet-4 and LeNet-5 for the MNIST dataset, the VGG-16, and ResNet-20 models for the CIFAR-10 dataset, and the VGG-19 and ResNet-50 models for the ImageNet dataset. These models are tested on the four adversarial test input generation approaches like BIM, JSMA, FGSM, and CW, and one DL testing method like DeepGauge to validate the efficiency of the suggested approach. The simulation results proved that the proposed approach obtained high coverage accuracy for each criterion on four adversarial test inputs and one DL testing method as compared to other models.","[Jammalamadaka, Kiran; Parveen, Nikhat] Koneru Lakshmaiah Educ Fdn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India",,"Jammalamadaka, K (corresponding author), Koneru Lakshmaiah Educ Fdn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, India.",jvskkiran@yahoo.com,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,1,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2196-1115,,J BIG DATA-GER,J.

It is often observed that the last fully connected (FC) layers of convolutional neural network possess higher discrimination power as compared to the convolutional and maxpooling layers whose goal is to preserve local and low-level information of the input image and down sample it to avoid overfitting. Inspired from the functionality of local binary pattern (LBP) operator, this paper proposes to induce discrimination into the mid layers of convolutional neural network by introducing a discriminatively boosted alternative to pooling (DBAP) layer that has shown to serve as a favourable replacement of early maxpooling layer in a convolutional neural network (CNN). A thorough research of the related works show that the proposed change in the neural architecture is novel and has not been proposed before to bring enhanced discrimination and feature visualisation power achieved from the mid layer features. The empirical results reveal that the introduction of DBAP layer in popular neural architectures such as AlexNet and LeNet produces competitive classification results in comparison to their baseline models as well as other ultra-deep models on several benchmark data sets. In addition, better visualisation of intermediate features can allow one to seek understanding and interpretation of black box behaviour of convolutional neural networks, used widely by the research community.","[Shafiq, Shakeel; Azim, Tayyaba] Inst Management Sci IMSci, Ctr Excellence IT, Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan",,"Azim, T (corresponding author), Inst Management Sci IMSci, Ctr Excellence IT, Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan.",tayyaba.azim@imsciences.edu.pk,,,,,,,62,2,2,3,8,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",,2376-5992,,PEERJ COMPUT SCI,PeerJ Comput.

The idea is to transform the threshold tuning problem into a constrained optimization problem (i e , minimizing the size of the pruned model subject to a constraint on the accuracy loss), and then use powerful derivative-free optimization algorithms to solve it. To compress a trained DNN, OLMP is conducted within a new iterative pruning and adjusting pipeline Empirical results show that OLMP can achieve the best pruning ratio on LeNet-style models (i.e., 114 times for LeNet-300-100 and 298 times for LeNet-5) compared with some state-of-the-art DNN pruning methods, and can reduce the size of an AlexNet-style network up to 82 times without accuracy loss.","[Li, Guiying; Qian, Chao; Jiang, Chunhui] Univ Sci & Technol China, Anhui Prov Key Lab Big Data Anal & Applicat, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xiaofen] Univ Birmingham, Sch Comp Sci, CERCIA, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Tang, Ke] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shenzhen Key Lab Computat Intelligence, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",,"Li, GY (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Anhui Prov Key Lab Big Data Anal & Applicat, Hefei 230027, Peoples R China.",lgy147@mail.ustc.edu.cn; chaoqian@ustc.edu.cn; beethove@mail.ustc.edu.cn; luxf@sustc.edu.cn; tangk3@sustc.edu.cn,,"Li, Guiying/0000-0002-9445-3451","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB1003102]; NSFC [61603367, 61672478, 2016QNRC001]; Science and Technology Innovation Committee Foundation of Shenzhen [ZDSYS201703031748284]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Innovation Committee Foundation of Shenzhen,"This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFB1003102), the NSFC (61603367, 61672478), the YESS (2016QNRC001), and the Science and Technology Innovation Committee Foundation of Shenzhen (ZDSYS201703031748284).",,26,21,21,0,0,IJCAI-INT JOINT CONF ARTIF INTELL,FREIBURG,"ALBERT-LUDWIGS UNIV FREIBURG GEORGES-KOHLER-ALLEE, INST INFORMATIK, GEB 052, FREIBURG, D-79110, GERMANY",,,978-0-9992411-2-7,,,,2018.0,,,,,,,2383,2389,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BS7MQ,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000764175402073,0

This task, however, is extremely labor intensive, limiting the amount of quality environmental monitoring that can be done in the field. If the task was automated, teams would be able to monitor larger swaths of land. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for such automation using deep neural networks.

To this end, we create a dataset of labeled snippet images out of publicly available photoquadrats of the marshlands in Florida. Finally, we construct LeNet-5 and AlexNet, adjusted to our input snippets, faster training time, networks and experiment to learn them on our dataset for the binary classification task.

Nowadays, the convolutional neural network has become a vital tool in the conception of a TSR model. In this work, we propose an improved TSR algorithm for the transportation system inspired by the classical model LeNet-5. In this model, firstly, we replace the hyperbolic tangent activation function with a self-regularized non-monotonic activation function called SigmaH (SigmaH(x) = x tanh(root sigma(x))). SigmaH is experimentally validated on various popular benchmarks against the most suitable combinations of architectures and activation functions. Secondly, we use a convolutional block attention module, which is beneficial for extracting the most valuable features using the attention method. Finally, we combine the triplet-center loss with the Softmax activation function as a loss function to maximize the correct recognition rate. The TSR experiments are carried out based on the German Traffic Sign Recognition benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved LeNet-5 has an identification accuracy rate of 98.25%, and the average processing time per frame is 8 ms. In the meantime, the number of parameters is reduced by more than 51% compared with the classic LeNet-5 model. Our proposed model has remarkable accuracy and high training efficiency compared with other algorithms.","[Bouguezzi, Safa; Ben Fredj, Hana] Univ Monastir, Fac Sci Monastir, Monastir 5000, Tunisia; [Faiedh, Hassene; Souani, Chokri] Univ Sousse, Higher Inst Appl Sci & Technol, Sousse 4003, Tunisia",,"Bouguezzi, S (corresponding author), Univ Monastir, Fac Sci Monastir, Monastir 5000, Tunisia.",safa_bouguezzi@outlook.com,"souani, chokri/B-1853-2015","souani, chokri/0000-0002-8987-3582; bouguezzi, safa/0000-0001-5107-7508",,,,,44,1,1,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0178-2789,1432-2315,,VISUAL COMPUT,Visual Comput.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s00371-021-02211-5,0.0,,JUN 2021,18,"Computer Science, Software Engineering",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,TA7QV,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000667441600002,0

We propose our framework FixCaffe (Fixed Point Caffe), where fixed point matrix multiply function is substitute for part of the original floating point matrix multiply function in Caffe. We analyze the range of the operands during the training process, and choose the proper scaling factor for transform floating point operands to fixed point operands. Training LeNet-S model, obtained by modifying LeNet-5, on the MNIST benchmark, the result shows that after training 1000 iterations, FixCaffe with 8-bit fixed point multiplications only leads to about 0.5% loss in the classification accuracy compared to the single-precision floating point Caffe baseline.

Morphological identification of mosquitos is currently restricted due to the small number of adequately trained professionals. We implemented a computational model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from mosquito images to identify adult mosquitoes from the species Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus. To train the CNN to perform automatic morphological classification of mosquitoes, we used a dataset that included 4,056 mosquito images. Three neural networks, including LeNet, AlexNet and GoogleNet, were used. During the validation phase, the accuracy of the mosquito classification was 57.5% using LeNet, 74.7% using AlexNet and 83.9% using GoogleNet. During the testing phase, the best result (76.2%) was obtained using GoogleNet; results of 52.4% and 51.2% were obtained using LeNet and AlexNet, respectively. Significantly, accuracies of 100% and 90% were achieved for the classification of Aedes and Culex, respectively. A classification accuracy of 82% was achieved for Aedes females. Our results provide information that is fundamental for the automatic morphological classification of adult mosquito species in field. The use of CNN's is an important method for autonomous identification and is a valuable and accessible resource for health workers and taxonomists for the identification of some insects that can transmit infectious agents to humans.","[Motta, Daniel; Bandeira Santos, Alex Alisson; Winkler, Ingrid; Souza Machado, Bruna Aparecida; Dias Imperial Pereira, Daniel Andre; Cavalcanti, Alexandre Morais; Badaro, Roberto] Univ Ctr SENAI CIMATEC, Natl Serv Ind Learning SENAI, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Souza Machado, Bruna Aparecida; Lins Fonseca, Eduardo Oyama; Badaro, Roberto] Hlth Inst Technol CIMATEC ITS, Natl Serv Ind Learning SENAI, Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Kirchner, Frank] DFKI, Res Ctr Artificial Intelligence, Bremen, Germany",,"Machado, BAS (corresponding author), Univ Ctr SENAI CIMATEC, Natl Serv Ind Learning SENAI, Salvador, BA, Brazil.;Machado, BAS (corresponding author), Hlth Inst Technol CIMATEC ITS, Natl Serv Ind Learning SENAI, Salvador, BA, Brazil.",brunam@fieb.org.br,"Machado, Bruna/AAP-6877-2021; Motta, Daniel/AAW-1869-2021; Winkler, Ingrid/AAU-9884-2020; Santos, Alex A.B./J-4829-2012; Machado, Bruna Aparecida Souza/C-3130-2016; Kirchner, Frank/P-6503-2016","Winkler, Ingrid/0000-0001-6505-6636; Machado, Bruna Aparecida Souza/0000-0003-1655-0325; Kirchner, Frank/0000-0002-1713-9784",,,,,48,33,35,2,15,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JAN 14,2019.0,14,1,,,,,,,e0210829,10.1371/journal.pone.0210829,0.0,,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,HH5ZP,30640961.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000455808000050,0

This study aims to classify cloud objects in remote sensing satellite image data. The data used in this study is Pleiades very high-resolution satellite imagery data. The number of datasets used amounted to 1299 data. Cloud objects in this study are categorized into three classes, namely thick cloud, thin cloud, and clear. This study uses a deep learning algorithm, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of cloud objects. The CNN model used is LeNet with architectural modifications and parameters adjusted to the research needs. Classification of cloud objects with the LeNet model results in increased accuracy in each epoch during the training process and takes 1150.355 seconds for 200 epochs with the best accuracy value of 97.50%.

Nine explanatory factors covering precipitation, topographical, and anthropogenic aspects were selected and two CNNs, SCNN and LeNet-5, were implemented to identify the relationship between the explanatory factors and flood inventory between 2004 and 2014 in the Dahongmen catchment in Beijing, China. The performance of the CNNs was compared with that of support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) models for three model input strategies (point-based, array-based and imaged-based strategies). The results showed that (1) The two CNNs performed better than the SVM and RF, with an accuracy of 0.90 for SCNN and 0.88 for Lenet-5 in the testing period. (2) The CNN-based approach provided more reliable flood susceptibility maps than the comparative models with the highest area under the curve (AUC) index of 0.9 validating by another flood inventory. (3) The upstream inundations induced by pluvial flood cannot be accurately identified by using point-based and array-based strategies. These errors were corrected by considering topographical information using the imaged-based CNN approach. (4) The fixed architecture LeNet-5 produced satisfactory results and avoided the time-consuming process of architecture selection of CNN. We conclude that the proposed CNN-based approach is a valid approach and provides a high-quality susceptibility map for urban mitigation and flood management.","[Zhao, Gang; Pang, Bo; Xu, Zongxue; Peng, Dingzhi; Zuo, Depeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Gang] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England",,"Pang, B (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",pb@bnu.edu.cn,"Peng, Dingzhi/AAI-6706-2020; Peng, Dingzhi/E-2396-2013; Peng, Dingzhi/GQY-6569-2022; Peng, Dingzhi/ACA-5299-2022","Peng, Dingzhi/0000-0003-2118-5174; Peng, Dingzhi/0000-0003-2118-5174; Peng, Dingzhi/0000-0003-2118-5174; Peng, Dingzhi/0000-0003-2118-5174; Zhao, Gang/0000-0002-0278-502X; Zuo, Depeng/0000-0002-4549-453X",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1502701]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51879008]; China Scholarship Council [201906045024]; China Scholarship Council-University of Bristol [201700260088],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); China Scholarship Council-University of Bristol,"Bo Pang is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China during the 13th Five-year Plan (2017YFC1502701), National Natural Science Foundation of China (51879008) and China Scholarship Council (No. 201906045024).

The MI between filters and class labels, also called Relevance, is computed using the filter's activation maps and the annotations. The filters having High Relevance (HRel) are considered to be more important. Consequently, the least important filters, which have lower Mutual Information with the class labels, are pruned. Unlike the existing MI based pruning methods, the proposed method determines the significance of the filters purely based on their corresponding activation map's relationship with the class labels. Architectures such as LeNet-5, VGG-16, ResNet-56, ResNet-110 and ResNet-50 are utilized to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed pruning method over MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. The proposed method shows the state-of-the-art pruning results for LeNet-5, VGG-16, ResNet-56, ResNet-110 and ResNet-50 architectures. In the experiments, we prune 97.98%, 84.85%, 76.89%, 76.95%, and 63.99% of Floating Point Operation (FLOP)s from LeNet-5, VGG-16, ResNet-56, ResNet-110, and ResNet-50 respectively. The proposed HRel pruning method outperforms recent state-of-the-art filter pruning methods. Even after pruning the filters from convolutional layers of LeNet-5 drastically (i.e., from 20, 50 to 2, 3, respectively), only a small accuracy drop of 0.52% is observed. Notably, for VGG-16, 94.98% parameters are reduced, only with a drop of 0.36% in top-1 accuracy. ResNet-50 has shown a 1.17% drop in the top-5 accuracy after pruning 66.42% of the FLOPs. In addition to pruning, the Information Plane dynamics of Information Bottleneck theory is analyzed for various Convolutional Neural Network architectures with the effect of pruning.

The multi-bit inputs are compactly represented as a single pulse width encoded input. This translates into reduced switching capacitance, compared to baseline digital implementation, and can enable low power neural network computing in an edge device. The time-domain CNN engine employs a novel bi-directional memory delay line (MDL) unit to perform signed accumulation of input and weight products. The proposed MDL design leverages standard digital circuits and does not require any capacitors and complex analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to realize the convolution operation, thereby enabling easy scaling across the process technology nodes. Four speed-up modes and a configurable MDL length are supported to address throughput versus accuracy trade-off of the time-domain computing approach. Delay calibration units have been accommodated to mitigate the process variation induced delay mismatch among concurrently operating MDL units. The proposed time-domain MDL design implements a LeNet-5 CNN engine in a commercial 40-nm CMOS process achieving an energy efficiency of 12.08 TOPS/W, a throughput of 0.365 GOPS at 537 mV in the 16 speed-up mode. 40-nm CMOS test-chip measurements over 100 MNIST images show 97; classification accuracy. Simulation results over the entire 10 000 MNIST validation dataset images taking into account the circuit non-ideal effects of the MDL-based time-domain approach show a classification accuracy of 98.42;. The test-chip is operational down to the near-threshold voltage (up to 375 mV) while maintaining the classification accuracy over 90; in the 1 $\times $ speed-up mode. Furthermore, two methods of scaling MDLs to multi-bit weights are proposed. Simulation results for 1000-class AlexNet over 50 000 ImageNet validation dataset images show classification accuracy loss within 1; when compared with software implementation. The proposed MDL based time-domain approach performing 1-bit/8-bit weight and 8-bit input MAC operations when compared with the corresponding baseline digital implementations shows 2.09 higher energy efficiency and 2.22 smaller area.","[Sayal, Aseem; Nibhanupudi, S.

In AD, brain is the primarily affected region. Bio-markers of AD can be obtained from brain images which can help in classification of the disease. Traditional image processing technologies struggle to process the images due to the intricate nature of brain tissues. Deep Neural Network (DNN) is a well-known Machine Learning (ML) approach that helps to take decisions from complex situations. DNN is widely used in the applications of image processing such as classification. In this work, some of the most famous DNN models are implemented for AD classification using brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. All of the data utilised in this study are obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: ADNI-online data set. According to the findings of the experiment, all the models have their average performance rate below 90%. It is also observed that, because of simple and effective architectures, LeNet and AlexNet consume the least computational time (64 s and 74 s per epoch respectively) amongst all the implemented models. Hence, to design a model that can perform better and faster, we have combined LeNet and AlexNet parallelly and proposed a hybrid approach for AD classification. It is observed that the hybrid method performs convincingly with an average performance rate of 90.68%. The average computational time taken by the hybrid model is 120 s per epoch which is faster than all other discussed models (except LeNet and AlexNet).","[Hazarika, Ruhul Amin; Kandar, Debdatta; Maji, Arnab Kumar] NEHU, Dept Informat Technol, Shillong 793022, Meghalaya, India",,"Hazarika, RA; Maji, AK (corresponding author), NEHU, Dept Informat Technol, Shillong 793022, Meghalaya, India.",,,"Maji, Arnab Kumar/0000-0002-3320-9965",,,,,30,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2367-3370,2367-3389,978-3-030-96299-9; 978-3-030-96298-2,LECT NOTE NETW SYST,,,2022.0,419,,,,,,381,390,,10.1007/978-3-030-96299-9_37,0.0,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BS8NX,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000773951800037,0

As the von Neumann architecture is inefficient for NN computation, researchers have been investigating new semiconductor devices and architectures for neuromorphic computing. The crossbar RRAM, which is an emerging non-volatile memory composed of memristor devices, can be used to accelerate or emulate the NN computation. However, the memristor device defects exposed during manufacturing or field use may cause performance degradation in the NN, causing reliability issues to the neuromorphic hardware. In this paper, we consider two existing fault models for the 1T1R RRAM cell, i.e., the stuck-at fault and transistor stuck-on fault. Evaluation of their influence to the NN shows that for about 10% faulty cells in the memristor array, the accuracy for the MLP model degrades about 10%, and that for the LeNet 300-100 and LeNet 5 degrades by more than 65%. Therefore, we propose a self-healing and an error correction approach to reduce the accuracy degradation, and improve the reliability (lifetime) of the neuromorphic hardware. Our simulation results show that if we limit the accuracy degradation to within 5%, then the proposed error correction approach for the MLP model will be able to tolerate up to 40% faulty cells, and even up to 60% faulty cells for LeNet 300-100 and LetNet 5 models. Also, the error correction method can extend the lifetime of the neuromorphic hardware by 5% or more.","[Hu, Jia-Yun; Hou, Kuan-Wei; Wu, Cheng-Wen] Natl Tsing Hua Univ NTHU, Dept EE, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Lo, Chih-Yen; Chou, Yung-Fa; Wu, Cheng-Wen] Ind Technol Res Inst ITRI, ICL, Hsinchu, Taiwan",,"Hu, JY (corresponding author), Natl Tsing Hua Univ NTHU, Dept EE, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",,,,"Winbond, R.O.","Winbond, R.O.","This work is in part supported by Winbond, R.O.",,18,2,2,1,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-5180-3,,,,2018.0,,,,,,,19,24,,10.1109/ITC-Asia.2018.00014,0.0,,,6,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BS4KR,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000719865700004,0

A smart deep convolutional neural network, using the improved LeNet-5 structure (ShrimpNet), is proposed to address this problem. Shrimp image segmentation, normalization and data augmentation were initially performed. Given the morphological differences in the external features of shrimp, the LeNet-5 structure was modified into a three-layer parallel structure for efficient matching and identification. A combination classifier strategy was subsequently added into the fully connected layers to strengthen the feature expression in the corresponding classes. Finally, different architectures were explored by shrinking the depth and width to search for effective network structures that could act as alternatives for practical applications and reveal the practical use of ShrimpNet. Experimental results revealed that the smaller model (ShrimpNet-3) could achieve a validation accuracy of 96.84% and a modeling time of 0.47 h for the constructed dataset. Therefore, the proposed method is promising for shrimp classification and quality measurement of production lines.","[Liu, Zihao; Jia, Xiaojun] Jiaxing Univ, Coll Math Phys & Informat Engn, Jiaxing 314001, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xinsheng] China Jiliang Univ, Coll Qual & Safety Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,"Liu, ZH (corresponding author), Jiaxing Univ, Coll Math Phys & Informat Engn, Jiaxing 314001, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",lzh2017@cjlu.edu.cn,,,Scientific Research Foundation of Jiaxing University; city public welfare technology application research project of Jiaxing Science and Technology Bureau [2018AY11008]; National Social Science Funds [18ZDA079]; Active Design Projects of Key R&D Plans of Zhejiang Province [2019C01128]; Public Welfare Technology Research of Zhejiang Province [LGF19G030004],Scientific Research Foundation of Jiaxing University; city public welfare technology application research project of Jiaxing Science and Technology Bureau; National Social Science Funds; Active Design Projects of Key R&D Plans of Zhejiang Province; Public Welfare Technology Research of Zhejiang Province,"This work was financially supported by the Scientific Research Foundation of Jiaxing University, the city public welfare technology application research project of Jiaxing Science and Technology Bureau (No. 2018AY11008), the National Social Science Funds (No. 18ZDA079), 2019 Active Design Projects of Key R&D Plans of Zhejiang Province (No. 2019C01128) and 2019 Projects on Public Welfare Technology Research of Zhejiang Province (No. LGF19G030004).

The 1S - 1R structure consists of a four-terminal memristor acting as a selector and a two-terminal memristor storing information in the form of device resistances. The high resistance state (HRS) and the low resistance state (LRS) of two-terminal memristor are used in conjunction to represent binary weight in binary neural networks (BNN), and multiply-accumulate operation of convolution can be replaced by the current accumulation of the 1S - 1R circuit. With the purpose of mapping binary weights into the 1S - 1R array to implement the forward propagation at the circuit simulation level, a LeNet model has been modified herein where two full-precision convolution layers are replaced by two binary convolutional layers. Compared with the full-precision LeNet model, the storage resource consumption of the binarized network is reduced by 44.28%, while the accuracy can reach 98% in 10 epochs, which is very close to the full-precision network. The 1S - 1R array is used subsequently to store the binary weight of a convolution layer in the trained LeNet and 100 pictures with numbers 0 to 9 in MNIST are randomly selected for testing. As expected, the result obtained through circuit simulation is consistent with the convolution operation in the process of forward propagation.","[Zhang, Zhang; Ge, Zhiheng; Wei, Yadong; Cheng, Xin; Xie, Guangjun] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Microelect, Hefei 230601, Peoples R China; [Liu, Gang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",,"Liu, G (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",zhangzhang@hfut.edu.cn; gang.liu@sjtu.edu.cn,"zhang, zhang/GQZ-6804-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [U19A2053]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities [JZ2020YYPY0089, PA2021KCPY0043]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (U19A2053) and the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities (JZ2020YYPY0089, PA2021KCPY0043).",,28,0,0,8,24,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-9317,1873-5568,,MICROELECTRON ENG,Microelectron.

We propose a heterogeneous hardware-software based architecture for performing inference in feed-forward neural networks which is capable of early exiting through intermediate exits according to the difficulty level of the input. Our proposed architecture can be reconfigured to support different kernel sizes and is fully scalable. Our experiments show an increase in classification accuracy by 0.27% for MNIST dataset (LeNet) with 2.2x decrease in average computations and 1.07% for Cifar-10 dataset (AlexNet) with 1.55x decrease in average computations along with 1.39x reduction in energy consumption for LeNet architecture.","[Paul, Debdeep; Mathew, Jimson] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Patna, Bihar, India; [Singh, Jawar] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Patna, Bihar, India",,"Paul, D (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Patna, Bihar, India.",debdeep.ee15@iitp.ac.in; jawar@iitp.ac.in; jimson@iitp.ac.in,,"Singh, Jawar/0000-0002-6351-9884",,,,,11,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-1557-3,,,,2019.0,,,,,,,118,122,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Telecommunications,BS3DU,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000709842500024,0

This paper introduces a newmethod to improve DNNs performance by fusing approximate computing with data reuse techniques for image recognition applications. First, starting from the pre-trained network, then the DNNs weights are approximated based on the linear and quadratic approximation methods during the retraining phase to reduce the DNN model size and number of arithmetic operations. Then, the DNNs weights are replaced with the linear/quadratic coefficients to execute the inference so that different DNNs weights can be computed using the same coefficients. That leads to a repetition of the weights, which enables the reuse of the DNN sub-computations (computational reuse) and leverages the same data (data reuse) to reduce DNNs computations memory accesses, and improve energy efficiency, albeit at the cost of increased training time. Complete analysis for MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, and tiny ImageNet datasets is presented for image recognition, where different DNN models are used, including LeNet, ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG16. Our results show that the linear approximation achieves 1211.3x, 21.8x, 700x, and 19.3x on LeNet-5 MNIST, LeNet Fashion MNIST, VGG16 and ResNet-20. respectively, with small accuracy loss. Compared to the state-of-the-art Row Stationary (RS) method, the proposed architecture saved 54% of the total number of adders and multipliers needed.

When performing repeated read operations on several devices at various read frequencies and under various biasing and programming conditions, non-Normal variation in I-DS is observed. Device-circuit co-analysis is used to emulate PIM performance subject to noise when classifying images. Marginal degradation is observed in Fashion-MNIST classification accuracy using LeNet-5, and more significant degradation is observed in CIFAR-10 classification accuracy using MobileNetV2. Variation-aware training is shown to fully recover minor drops in LeNet-5 accuracy but becomes difficult for large workloads like MobileNetV2.

However, mineralization is a rare event. Insufficient known mineral deposits cannot meet the sample requirement of supervised learning methods, resulting in lower predictive accuracies and poor generalization abilities. For the purpose of solving this issue, this paper adopted a data augmentation method to make mineral prospectivity prediction of gold deposit in the Fengxian Region, China. This data augmentation method adopted cropping operations to generate sufficient training samples without changing spatial directions of geological data. Meanwhile, this paper utilized the continuous buffer distance method to quantify faults and anticline axes, overcoming the loss of geological information caused by using the discrete buffer distance mode. To prove the effectiveness of the data augmentation method, this paper utilized three different convolutional neural networks (LeNet, AlexNet, and VggNet) to extract relationships between multisource ore-indicating factors and mineral deposits. In addition, this paper discussed effects of different parameters on predictive performances. According to series of comparisons, the LeNet model outperformed other models, achieving superior values of accuracy (91.38%), Kappa coefficient (0.8119), and AUC (0.958). Moreover, the LeNet model successfully caught 81.8% of known gold deposits within 18.6% of the study area. The delineated high potential areas offer intuitive guides for exploring more gold deposits in the Fengxian region. The proposed data augmentation method is available for mineral prospectivity modeling by supervised deep learning methods for the areas of lower exploration degrees. For mineral prospectivity modeling based on convolutional neural networks, utilizing the continuous buffer distance to transform faults and anticline axes into predictor variables of the image form is conducive to improve the predictive performance than utilizing the discrete buffer distance.","[Yang, Na; Zhang, Zhenkai; Yang, Jianhua; Hong, Zenglin] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Automat, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Yang, Na; Zhang, Zhenkai; Yang, Jianhua; Hong, Zenglin] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Res Ctr Intelligent Geol Survey, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhenkai] Shaanxi Ctr Mineral Geol Survey, Xian 710068, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhenkai] Nat Resources Shaanxi Satellite Applicat Technol, Xian 710119, Peoples R China; [Hong, Zenglin] Shaanxi Inst Geol Survey, Xian 710054, Peoples R China",,"Yang, JH; Hong, ZL (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Automat, Xian 710072, Peoples R China.",yangjianhua@nwpu.edu.cn; hongzenglin1963@163.com,,,"research on intelligent mineral prospectivity prediction of gold deposits in Fengtai ore cluster area, Shaanxi Province, China [2021KJXX-87]; study on 3D intelligent prediction of gold deposit resources in Pangjiahe, Fengxian County, Shaanxi Province, China [202103]; study on gold metallogenic regularity and prospecting direction in Fengtai ore cluster area, Shaanxi Province, China [201918]; construction of geoscience big data in Shaanxi province [20180301]","research on intelligent mineral prospectivity prediction of gold deposits in Fengtai ore cluster area, Shaanxi Province, China; study on 3D intelligent prediction of gold deposit resources in Pangjiahe, Fengxian County, Shaanxi Province, China; study on gold metallogenic regularity and prospecting direction in Fengtai ore cluster area, Shaanxi Province, China; construction of geoscience big data in Shaanxi province","No conflicts of interest exist in this article, and this article has been approved by all authors for publication.

Myelin facilitates rapid neural signal transmission. Any damage to myelin disrupts neuronal communication leading to neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). There is no cure for MS. This is, in part, due to lack of an efficient method for myelin quantification during drug screening. In this study, an image analysis based myelin sheath detection method, DeepMQ, is developed. The method consists of a feature extraction step followed by a deep learning based binary classification module. The images, which were acquired on a confocal microscope contain three channels and multiple z-sections. Each channel represents either oligodendroyctes, neurons, or nuclei. During feature extraction, 26-neighbours of each voxel is mapped onto a 2D feature image. This image is, then, fed to the deep learning classifier, in order to detect myelin. Results indicate that 93.38% accuracy is achieved in a set of fluorescence microscope images of mouse stem cell-derived oligodendroyctes and neurons.

Additionally, a parameter reduction comparison between neuron and weight pruning is shown. It will be empirically shown that the proposed neuron pruning reduces the number of parameters dramatically. The evaluation is performed on two tasks, the MNIST handwritten digit recognition and the LFW face verification, using a LeNet-5 and a VGG16 network architecture. The network size is reduced by up to 74% and 61%, respectively, without affecting the network's performance. The main advantage of neuron pruning is its direct influence on the size of the network architecture.

Visual perception technology (VPT) can intuitively grasp the surface damage situation of WRs. However, efficient detection of WR surface damage from complex morphological characteristics using VPT has always been a challenging task, and there are various problems, such as nonstandard data, low automation/intelligence, and poor detection effect. To overcome the above difficulties, this study proposes a deep learning-based VPT framework, which relies on an image preprocessing (IP) scheme and a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), called WR-IPDCNN. The IP scheme is designed to remove the influence of the image background and to normalize data, including posture adjustment and region of interest (ROI) extraction. The improved DCNN based on LeNet-5 is proposed to mine the newly established WR data set, which considers different working conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately extract the ROI area of WR images and achieve 95.55% detection accuracy, which is 12.44% higher than LeNet-5, and a significant improvement on the automation/intelligence level in this field.","[Zhou, Ping; Zhou, Gongbo; Wang, Dongxu] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Mechatron Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Mine Mech & Elect Equipment, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Houlian] Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Zhenjiang 212000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [He, Zhenzhi] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Zhou, GB (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Mechatron Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Mine Mech & Elect Equipment, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",gbzhou@cumt.edu.cn,,"zhou, gongbo/0000-0001-9759-1895",National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC0600905]; Jiangsu Provincial Outstanding Youth Fund of China [BK20180033]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),National Key Research and Development Program; Jiangsu Provincial Outstanding Youth Fund of China; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program under Grant 2016YFC0600905, in part by the Jiangsu Provincial Outstanding Youth Fund of China under Grant BK20180033, and in part by the Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).

The proposed methodology is to classify brain stroke MRI images into normal and abnormal images and delineate abnormal regions using semantic segmentation [4]. In particular, two types of convolutional neural network that are LeNet [2] and SegNet are used. For classification, we passed pre-processed stroke MRI for training, trained all layers of LeNet and classify normal and abnormal patient. Then this abnormal patient data stored into two dimensional array and passed this two dimensional array to SegNet which is auto encoder decoder [3] model for segmentation, trained all layers of SegNet except fully connection layer.

We can use fog computing to process these data, considering that there is the possibility of overloading the network towards the cloud. In this context, deep learning can treat these data, but the memory requirements of deep neural networks may prevent them from executing on a single resource-constrained device. Furthermore, their computational requirements may yield an unfeasible execution time. In this work, we propose Deep Neural Networks Partitioning for Constrained IoT Devices, a new algorithm to partition neural networks for efficient distributed execution. Our algorithm can optimize the neural network inference rate or the number of communications among devices. Additionally, our algorithm accounts appropriately for the shared parameters and biases of Convolutional Neural Networks. We investigate the inference rate maximization for the LeNet model in constrained setups. We show that the partitionings offered by popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or by the general-purpose framework METIS may produce invalid partitionings for very constrained setups. The results show that our algorithm can partition LeNet for all the proposed setups, yielding up to 38% more inferences per second than METIS.","[Campos de Oliveira, Fabiola Martins; Bonin, Edson] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Comp, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil",,"de Oliveira, FMC; Bonin, E (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Comp, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil.",fabiola.oliveira@ic.unicamp.br; borin@unicamp.br,"Martins Campos de Oliveira, Fabíola/AEF-2800-2022","Martins Campos de Oliveira, Fabíola/0000-0001-8531-4559; Borin, Edson/0000-0003-1783-4231","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) [001]; CNPq [142235/2017-2, 313012/2017-2]; FAPESP [2013/08293-7]; Microsoft; Petrobras; PROCAD [2966/2014]",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Microsoft(Microsoft); Petrobras(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Amapa (FAPEAP)Petrobras); PROCAD,"This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001 and PROCAD 2966/2014 -, by CNPq (142235/2017-2 and 313012/2017-2), FAPESP (2013/08293-7), Microsoft, and Petrobras.",,50,10,10,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1999-5903,,FUTURE INTERNET,Future Internet,OCT,2019.0,11,10,,,,,,,209,10.3390/fi11100209,0.0,,,30,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,JI5QU,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000493523100005,0

We collect a vast amount of acoustic data from NZ waters through the use of passive acoustic monitoring and design a preprocessing strategy that converts raw audio signals into spectrograms. A dataset of bottlenose dolphin click detection is created. Four traditional image classification methods and six convolutional neural networks (CNNs), i.e., LeNet, LeNet variants, and ResNet-18, are designed to solve this task.

Several methods have been used for EIT image reconstruction, such as Simulated Annealing, Gauss Newton, Kalman filter and D-Bar. Recently, some authors solved this problem using artificial neural network (ANN) through pixel by pixel reconstruction, considering a fixed resolution for the final image. This work proposes a reconstruction based on the EIT forward problem. Two different meshes were considered: a coarse and a refined mesh. The latter was used to produce simulated potentials, which are the inputs for ANN training. The nodes conductivities, which used to create the outputs for training, defined in the coarser mesh. Therefore, the proposed method consists of training the ANN with inputs from a refined mesh and outputs from a coarse mesh. Two ANN architectures are proposed and compared: one based on the LeNet architecture, and another based on the feed-forward fully connected ANN. The obtained image is not dependent on any image resolution. The preliminary results show that the LeNet architecture has better performance.

Herewe introduce the cell division technique, which is a variant of function-preserving transformations. With this technique, it is guaranteed that CNNs that have weights quantized to fixed-point format of arbitrary bit-widths, can be transformed to CNNs with less bit-widths of weights without any accuracy drop (or any accuracy change). As a result, CNN hardware accelerators are released from the weight bit-width constraint, which has been preventing them from having narrower datapaths. In addition, CNNs that have wider weight bit-widths than those assumed by a CNN hardware accelerator can be executed on the accelerator. Experimental results on LeNet-300-100, LeNet-5, AlexNet, and VGG-16 show that weights can be reduced down to 2-5 bits with 2.5x-5.2x decrease in weight storage requirement and of course without any accuracy drop.","[Park, Hanmin; Choi, Kiyoung] Seoul Natl Univ, NPRC, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Seoul, South Korea",,"Park, H (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, NPRC, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Seoul, South Korea.",hpark@dal.snu.ac.kr; kchoi@snu.ac.kr,,,Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT); Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center (ISRC),Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT); Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center (ISRC),This work was supported by Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) and Inter-university Semiconductor Research Center (ISRC).,,23,3,3,1,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-6007-4,,,,2019.0,,,,,,,286,291,,10.1145/3287624.3287721,0.0,,,6,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BO2PP,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000507459700054,0

Therefore, it is important to accelerate CNN by only the CPU efficiently. In this paper, we propose a method to accelerate CNN by using the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) unit integrated in many CPUs. Modern CPU includes a SIMD unit which is commonly used for vector operations. The proposed method implemented on an ARM's NEON can maximize the utilization of vector registers in the SIMD unit.

In this paper, we propose a novel network compression method called Adaptive Dimension Adjustment Tucker decomposition (ADA-Tucker). With learnable core tensors and transformation matrices, ADA-Tucker performs Tucker decomposition of arbitrary-order tensors. Furthermore, we propose that weight tensors in networks with proper order and balanced dimension are easier to be compressed. Therefore, the high flexibility in decomposition choice distinguishes ADA-Tucker from all previous low-rank models. To compress more, we further extend the model to Shared Core ADA-Tucker (SCADA-Tucker) by defining a shared core tensor for all layers. Our methods require no overhead of recording indices of non-zero elements. Without loss of accuracy, our methods reduce the storage of LeNet-5 and LeNet-300 by ratios of 691x and 233x, respectively, significantly outperforming state of the art.

Learning-based low-light enhancement methods have robust feature learning and mapping capabilities. Therefore, we propose a learning-based joint contrast enhancement and noise suppression method for low-light images (termed JCENS). JCENS is mainly composed of three subnetworks: the low-light image denoising network (LDNet), the attention feature extraction network (AENet), and the low-light image enhancement network (LENet). In particular, LDNet produces a low-light image devoid of unwanted noise. AENet mitigates the impact of LDNet's denoising process on local details and generates attention enhancement features. Ultimately, LENet combine the outputs of LDNet and AENet to produce a noise-free and normal-light-enhanced image. The proposed joint contrast enhancement and noise suppression network is capable of achieving a balance between brightness enhancement and noise suppression, thereby better preserving salient image details. Both synthetic and realistic experiments have demonstrated the superior performance of our JCENS in terms of quantitative evaluations and visual image qualities.","[Gao, Yuan; Zheng, Yijie] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Nav, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Su, Jianlong] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Artificial Intelligence, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Bao, Mengwei] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Transportat & Logist Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China",,"Gao, Y (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Nav, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",yuangao@whut.edu.cn; yijiezheng@whut.edu.cn; jianlongsu@whut.edu.cn; mengweibao@whut.edu.cn,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-6784-1,,,,2022.0,,,,,,,277,282,,10.1109/ICRAS55217.2022.9842021,0.0,,,6,Automation & Control Systems; Robotics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Robotics,BT8HQ,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000853380900050,0

Converting convolutional layers into frequency domain significantly reduces the computation complexity of the sliding window operations in space domain. On the other hand, weight pruning techniques address the redundancy in model parameters by converting dense convolutional kernels into sparse ones. To obtain high-throughput FPGA implementation, we propose SPEC2 - the first work to prune and accelerate spectral CNNs. First, we propose a systematic pruning algorithm based on Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The offline pruning iteratively sets the majority of spectral weights to zero, without using any handcrafted heuristics. Then, we design an optimized pipeline architecture on FPGA that has efficient random access into the sparse kernels and exploits various dimensions of parallelism in convolutional layers. Overall, SPEC2 achieves high inference throughput with extremely low computation complexity and negligible accuracy degradation. We demonstrate SPEC2 by pruning and implementing LeNet and VGG16 on the Xilinx Virtex platform. After pruning 75% of the spectral weights, SPEC2 achieves 0% accuracy loss for LeNet, and < 1% accuracy loss for VGG16. The resulting accelerators achieve up to 24x higher throughput, compared with the state-of-the-art FPGA implementations for VGG16.","[Niu, Yue; Zeng, Hanqing; Srivastava, Ajitesh; Lakhotia, Kartik; Prasanna, Viktor] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Kannan, Rajgopal] US Army Res Lab West, Adelphi, MD USA; [Wang, Yanzhi] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Niu, Y (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",yueniu@usc.edu; zengh@usc.edu; ajiteshs@usc.edu; klakhoti@usc.edu; rajgopal.kannan.civ@mail.mil; yanz.wang@northeastern.edu; prasanna@usc.edu,"Zeng, Hanqing/AAG-4038-2019; Niu, Yue/AAQ-8856-2021","Zeng, Hanqing/0000-0002-2578-2147; ",National Science Foundation [CNS-1643351],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported in part by National Science Foundation award number CNS-1643351.,,31,5,5,0,3,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-1-7281-4535-8,,,,2019.0,,,,,,,195,204,,10.1109/HiPC.2019.00033,0.0,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BQ0XI,,Green Submitted,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000574772000022,0

These facts were relevant to the growth in the number of accidents, which from 2016 to 2017 was 7,272, and approximately 38% of these were caused by sleepy drivers. In this work, the use of three Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques will be highlighted for the development of the real-time application of the eye state classifier: Artificial Neural Network (RNA) and two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These techniques were submitted to offline processing (which required a database with 811 photos) and online.

A typical CNN takes a very long development round on FPGAs, hence in this paper, we propose a tool which allows developers, through a configurable user-interface, to automatically generate VHDL code for their desired CNN model. The generated code or architecture is modular, massively parallel, reconfigurable, scalable, fully pipelined, and adaptive to different CNN models. We demonstrate the automatic VHDL generator and its adaptability by implementing a small-scale CNN model LeNet and a large-scale one AlexNet. The parameters of small scale models are automatically hard-coded as constants (part of the programmable logic) to overcome the memory bottleneck issue. On a Xilinx Virtex-7 running at 200 MHz, the system is capable of processing up to 125k images/s of size 28x28 for LeNet and achieved a peak performance of 611.52 GOP/s and 414 FPS for AlexNet.","[Hamdan, Muhammad K.; Rover, Diane T.] Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Ames, IA 50011 USA",,"Hamdan, MK (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",mhamdan@iastate.edu; drover@iastate.edu,,,,,,,15,4,4,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2325-6532,,978-1-5386-3797-5,PROC INT CONF RECON,,,2017.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BJ6DX,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000426529700049,0

We recently make another trial to implement convolutional neural network (CNN) on the classification of pulmonary nodules of thoracic CT images. The biggest challenge in medical image classification with the help of CNN is the difficulty of acquiring enough samples, and overfitting is a common problem when there are not enough images for training. Transfer learning has been verified as reasonable in dealing with such problems with an acceptable loss value. We use the classic LeNet-5 model to classify pulmonary nodules of thoracic CT images, including benign and malignant pulmonary nodules, and different malignancies of the malignant nodules. The CT images are obtained from Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) where both pulmonary nodule scanning and nodule annotations are available. These images are labeled and stored in a medical images knowledge base (KB), which is designed and implemented in our previous work.

In order to solve the problems of small face image samples, high size, low structure, no label, and difficulty in tracking and recapture in security videos, we propose a popular multiscale facial feature manifold (MSFFM) algorithm based on VGG16. Method. We first build the VGG16 architecture to obtain face features at different scales and construct a multiscale face feature manifold with face features at different scales as dimensions. At the same time, the recognition rate, accuracy rate, and running time are used to evaluate the performance of VGG16, LeNet-5, and DenseNet on the same database. Results. From the results of comparative experiments, it can be seen that the recognition rate and accuracy of VGG16 are the highest among the three networks. The recognition rate of VGG16 is 97.588%, and the accuracy is 95.889%. And the running time is only 3.5 seconds, which is 72.727% faster than LeNet-5 and 66.666% faster than DenseNet. Conclusion. The model proposed in this paper breaks through the key problem in the face detection and tracking problem in the public security field, predicts the position of the face target image in the time dimension manifold space, and improves the efficiency of face detection.","[Ge, Huilin; Zhu, Zhiyu; Liu, Runbang; Wu, Xuedong] Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Elect Informat, Zhenjiang 212003, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Ge, HL (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Elect Informat, Zhenjiang 212003, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",ghl1989@just.edu.cn; zhuzy@just.edu.cn; liurunbang212@just.edu.cn; woolcn@163.com,,"Wu, Xuedong/0000-0001-6852-2276",National Natural Science Foundation of China [62006102],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62006102).,,37,1,1,7,16,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-725X,1687-7268,,J SENSORS,J.

However, they require computationally intensive operations for embedded applications. In recent years, FPGA-based CNN accelerators have been proposed to improve energy efficiency and throughput. While dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) is increasingly used in CNN accelerators, the performance of dynamically reconfigurable accelerators is usually lower than the performance of pure static FPGA designs. This work presents a dynamically reconfigurable CNN accelerator architecture that does not sacrifice throughput performance or classification accuracy. The proposed accelerator is composed of reconfigurable macroblocks and dynamically utilizes the device resources according to model parameters. Moreover, we devise a novel approach, to the best of our knowledge, to hide the computations of the pooling layers inside the convolutional layers, thereby further improving throughput. Using the proposed architecture and DPR, different CNN architectures can be realized on the same FPGA with optimized throughput and accuracy. The proposed architecture is evaluated by implementing two different LeNet CNN models trained by different datasets and classifying different classes.

However, the problem of finding an optimal DNN architecture for large applications is challenging. Common approaches go for deeper and larger DNN architectures but may incur substantial redundancy. To address these problems, we introduce a network growth algorithm that complements network pruning to learn both weights and compact DNN architectures during training. We propose a DNN synthesis tool (NeST) that combines both methods to automate the generation of compact and accurate DNNs. NeSTstarts with a randomly initialized sparse network called the seed architecture. It iteratively tunes the architecture with gradient-based growth and magnitude-based pruning of neurons and connections. Our experimental results show that NeST yields accurate, yet very compact DNNs, with a wide range of seed architecture selection.

However, mainstream CNN models are too complicated to emerging Computing-In-Memory (CIM) architectures for hardware implementation, because enormous parameters and massive intermediate processing results may incur severe memory bottleneck. This paper proposed a design methodology of Parameter Substitution with Nodes Compensation (PSNC) to significantly reduce parameters of CNN model without inference accuracy degradation. Based on the PSNC methodology, an ultra-lightweight convolutional neural network (UL-CNN) was designed. The UL-CNN model is a specially optimized convolutional neural network aiming at a flash-based CIM architecture (Cony-Flash) and to apply for recognizing person. The implementation result of running UL-CNN on Cony-Flash shows that the inference accuracy is up to 94.7%. Compared to LeNet-5, on the premise of the similar operations and accuracy, the amounts of UL-CNN's parameters are less than 37% of LeNet-5 at the same dataset benchmark. Such parameter reduction can dramatically speed up the training process and economize on-chip storage overhead, as well as save the power consumption of the memory access. With the aid of UL-CNN, the Cony-Flash architecture can provide the best energy efficiency compared to other platforms (CPU, GPU, FPGA, etc.), which consumes only 2.2x 105J to complete pedestrian recognition for one frame.","[Yang, Chen; Zhang, Jingyu; Chen, Qi] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Microelect, 28 Xianning West Rd, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yi; Lu, Cimang] Hangzhou Flashbill Semicond Co Ltd, Bldg 17,57 Sci & Technol Pk Rd, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,"Yang, C (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Microelect, 28 Xianning West Rd, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",chyang00@xjtu.edu.cn; zjingyu@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; qchen20134728@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; Yi.Xu@Flashbillion.com; Cimang.Lu@Flashbillion.com,,,NNSF of China [61704136]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M631163]; Shaanxi Postdoctoral Research Project Foundation [2017BSHEDZZ29]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [Z201805200]; Guangdong Province Key RD projects [2019B010154002]; Key Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi Province [2019ZDLGY03-07-01],NNSF of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Shaanxi Postdoctoral Research Project Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Guangdong Province Key RD projects; Key Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi Province,"This work was supported by NNSF of China under Grant 61704136, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant 2018M631163, Shaanxi Postdoctoral Research Project Foundation under Grant 2017BSHEDZZ29, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant Z201805200, Guangdong Province Key R&D projects under Grant 2019B010154002, and the Key Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi Province under Grant 2019ZDLGY03-07-01.",,36,0,0,4,17,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0218-1266,1793-6454,,J CIRCUIT SYST COMP,J.

Nonetheless, most of the deep models verify the ruling maxim in deep learning-bigger is better-so they have very complex structures. As the models become more complex, the computational complexity and resource consumption of these deep models are increasing significantly, making them difficult to perform on resource-limited platforms, such as sensor platforms. In this paper, we observe that different layers often have different pruning requirements, and propose a differential evolutionary layer-wise weight pruning method. Firstly, the pruning sensitivity of each layer is analyzed, and then the network is compressed by iterating the weight pruning process. Unlike some other methods that deal with pruning ratio by greedy ways or statistical analysis, we establish an optimization model to find the optimal pruning sensitivity set for each layer. Differential evolution is an effective method based on population optimization which can be used to address this task. Furthermore, we adopt a strategy to recovery some of the removed connections to increase the capacity of the pruned model during the fine-tuning phase. The effectiveness of our method has been demonstrated in experimental studies. Our method compresses the number of weight parameters in LeNet-300-100, LeNet-5, AlexNet and VGG16 by 24x, 14x, 29x and 12x, respectively.","[Wu, Tao; Li, Xiaoyang; Zhou, Deyun; Li, Na; Shi, Jiao] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Elect & Informat, 127 West Youyi Rd, Xian 710072, Peoples R China",,"Li, XY (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Elect & Informat, 127 West Youyi Rd, Xian 710072, Peoples R China.",tao_woe@mail.nwpu.edu.cn; lixiaoyang@nwpu.edu.cn; dyzhounpu@nwpu.edu.cn; linaflydream@mail.nwpu.edu.cn; jiaoshi@nwpu.edu.cn,,"SHI, JIAO/0000-0003-1124-6738; Wu, Tao/0000-0002-6925-109X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [62076204]; National Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province [2018JQ6003, 2018JQ6030]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M613204, 2017M623246]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"This work was supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62076204), the National Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province under Grantnos. 2018JQ6003 and 2018JQ6030, the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant Nos. 2017M613204 and 2017M623246).",,36,6,6,3,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,FEB,2021.0,21,3,,,,,,,880,10.3390/s21030880,0.0,,,20,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,QD4QA,33525527.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000615503600001,0

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based malware traffic classification can automatically learn features from raw traffic, avoiding the inaccuracy of hand-design traffic features. Through the experiments and comparisons of LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, and ResNet, it is found that LeNet has good and stable classification ability for malware traffic and normal traffic. Then, a field programmable gate array (FPGA) accelerator for CNNs-based malware traffic classification is designed, which consists of a parameterized hardware accelerator and a fully automatic software framework. By fully exploring the parallelism between CNN layers, parallel computation and pipeline optimization are used in the hardware design to achieve high performance. Simultaneously, runtime reconfigurability is implemented by using a global register list. By encapsulating the underlying driver, a three-layer software framework is provided for users to deploy their pre-trained models. Finally, a typical CNNs-based malware traffic classification model was selected to test and verify the hardware accelerator.

The late fusion scheme has significantly enhanced the performance of the pedestrian recognition task. In this paper, the late fusion scheme connected with CNN learning is deeply investigated for pedestrian recognition based on the Daimler stereo vision dataset. Thus, an independent CNN for each imaging modality (Intensity, Depth, and Optical Flow) is used before the fusion of the CNN's probabilistic output scores with a Multi-Layer Perceptron which provides the recognition decision. We propose four different learning patterns based on Cross-Modality deep learning of Convolutional Neural Networks: (1) a Particular Cross-Modality Learning; (2) a Separate Cross-Modality Learning; (3) a Correlated Cross-Modality Learning and (4) an Incremental Cross-Modality Learning model. Moreover, we also design a new CNN architecture, called LeNet+, which improves the classification performance not only for each modality classifier, but also for the multi-modality late-fusion scheme. Finally, we propose to learn the LeNet+ model with the incremental cross-modality approach using optimal learning settings, obtained with a K-fold Cross Validation pattern. This method outperforms the state-of-the-art classifier provided with Daimler datasets on both non-occluded and partially-occluded pedestrian tasks.","[Pop, Danut Ovidiu; Nashashibi, Fawzi] INRIA Paris, RITS Team, 2 Rue Simone IFF, F-75012 Paris, France; [Pop, Danut Ovidiu; Rogozan, Alexandrina; Bensrhair, Abdelaziz] Normandie Univ, INSA Rouen, LITIS, F-76000 Rouen, France; [Pop, Danut Ovidiu] Babes Bolyai Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 7-9 Univ St, Cluj Napoca 400084, Romania",,"Pop, DO (corresponding author), INRIA Paris, RITS Team, 2 Rue Simone IFF, F-75012 Paris, France.;Pop, DO (corresponding author), Normandie Univ, INSA Rouen, LITIS, F-76000 Rouen, France.;Pop, DO (corresponding author), Babes Bolyai Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 7-9 Univ St, Cluj Napoca 400084, Romania.",danut-ovidiu.pop@inria.fr; alexandrina.rogozan@insa-rouen.fr; fawzi.nashashibi@inria.fr; abdelaziz.bensrhair@insa-rouen.fr,,"Pop, Danut/0000-0001-8434-5222; Nashashibi, Fawzi/0000-0002-4209-1233",Inria Paris and Normandy Region,Inria Paris and Normandy Region,This research was funded by Inria Paris and Normandy Region.,,38,3,3,5,30,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1939-1390,1941-1197,,IEEE INTEL TRANSP SY,IEEE Intell.

In addition to reducing trash and disposal, reusable items are predicted to be of great benefit since they lessen our dependence on raw materials. The usage of compostable trash may be expanded outside fertilizers and dung after the metallic, chemicals, and glass items have been recycled. After a good scrubbing, the glass may be broken down and remelted to create new items. Reusing waste items via garbage recovery is one of the best methods to do so. This document outlines the steps that must be taken to maximize the use of garbage.

Gripping, motion control, and object material categorization are all integrated into a full-automation, reusable system architecture in this study. LeNet also was adjusted to classify garbage into cartons and plastics using an artificial intelligent technique, with the use of a customized LeNet model. Movement in terms of moving the robot in the most efficient way possible, the robot's grabbing, and categorization were incorporated into the movement design process.

Therefore, the effective classification of satellite images is required to improve classification accuracy. In this paper, the combination of Hierarchical Framework and Ensemble Learning (HFEL) and optimal feature selection is proposed for the precise identification of satellite images. The HFEL uses three different types of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), namely AlexNet, LeNet-5 and a residual network (ResNet), to extract the appropriate features from images of the hierarchical framework. Additionally, the optimal features from the feature set are extracted using the Correlation Coefficient-Based Gravitational Search Algorithm (CCGSA). Further, the Multi Support Vector Machine (MSVM) is used to classify the satellite images by extracted features from the fully connected layers of the CNN and selected features of the CCGSA. Hence, the combination of HFEL and CCGSA is used to obtain the precise classification over different datasets such as the SAT-4, SAT-6 and Eurosat datasets. The performance of the proposed HFEL-CCGSA is analyzed in terms of accuracy, precision and recall. The experimental results show that the HFEL-CCGSA method provides effective classification over the satellite images.

However, their complex structure, high computation and storage resource limit their applications in mobile or embedding devices such as sensor platforms. Neural network pruning is an efficient way to design a lightweight model from a well-trained complex deep neural network. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary multi-objective one-shot filter pruning method for designing a lightweight convolutional neural network. Firstly, unlike some famous iterative pruning methods, a one-shot pruning framework only needs to perform filter pruning and model fine-tuning once. Moreover, we built a constraint multi-objective filter pruning problem in which two objectives represent the filter pruning ratio and the accuracy of the pruned convolutional neural network, respectively. A non-dominated sorting-based evolutionary multi-objective algorithm was used to solve the filter pruning problem, and it provides a set of Pareto solutions which consists of a series of different trade-off pruned models.

Apart from vanilla CNNs, we have state-of-the-art (SOTA) architectures such as ResNet50 (and its variants) which show that through the use of skip-connections, higher performance metrics are attainable through deeper architectures. However, most evaluative metrics converge on a log scale as we go deeper with diminishing gradient of the metrics' curves. Given these two contrasting speculations, in this paper, we implement various vanilla and SOTA CNNs for the diagnosis of one of the most common forms of breast cancer - invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) - to examine and understand the feasibility of implementation of SOTA CNNs through transferred weights when juxtaposed with vanilla CNNs (and LeNet-5) of varying configurations in terms of their performance metrics and other parameters. In this paper, we solve the dual-objective of studying behavioural aspects of avant-garde CNN models (more specifically, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121) and proper diagnosis of IDC through intermediate neural activations to critically evaluate and theorize the performance of different models. We notice that among all the models, only VGG16, VGG19, LeNet-5 and a selected vanilla CNN through an optimization procedure were the ones to attain the best metrics, shared amongst them.","[Harshvardhan, G.

Human activity recognition (HAR) can play an important role to provide the elders with in-time healthcare. With the advantages of environmental insensitivity, contactless sensing and privacy protection, radar has been widely used for human activity detection. The micro-Doppler signatures (spectrograms) contain much information about human motion and are often applied in HAR. However, spectrograms only interpret magnitude information, resulting in suboptimal performances. We propose a radar-based HAR system using deep learning techniques. The data applied came from the open dataset Radar signatures of human activities created by the University of Glasgow. A new type of hybrid map was proposed, which concatenated the spectrograms amplitude and phase. After cropping the hybrid maps to focus on useful information, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on LeNet-5 was designed for feature extraction and classification. In addition, the idea of transfer learning was applied for radar-based HAR to evaluate the classification performance of a pre-trained network. For this, GoogLeNet was taken and trained on the newly-produced hybrid maps. These initial results showed that the LeNet-5 CNN using only the spectrograms obtained an accuracy of 80.5%, while using the hybrid maps reached an accuracy of 84.3%, increasing by 3.8%.

Purpose To explore the feasibility of applying deep learning to diagnose and classify labral injuries with MRI. Study Type Retrospective. Population A total of 1016 patients were divided into normal (n = 168, class 0) and abnormal labrum (n = 848) groups. The abnormal group consisted of n = 111 with class 1 (degeneration), n = 437 with class 2 (partial or complete tear), and n = 300 with unclassified injury. Patients were randomly divided into training, validation, and test cohort according to the ratio of 55%:15%:30%. Field Strength/Sequence Fat-saturation proton density-weighted fast spin-echo sequence at 3.0 T. Assessment Convolutional neural network-6 (CNN-6) was used to extract, discriminate, and detect oblique coronal (OCOR) and oblique sagittal (OSAG) images. Mask R-CNN was used for segmentation. LeNet-5 was used to diagnose and classify labral injuries. The weighting method combined the models of OCOR and OSAG. The output-input connection was used to correlate the whole diagnosis/classification system. Four radiologists performed subjective diagnoses to obtain the diagnosis results. Statistical Tests CNN-6 and LeNet-5 were evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and related parameters. The mean average precision (MAP) evaluated the Mask R-CNN. McNemar's test was used to compare the radiologists and models. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The area under the curve (AUC) of CNN-6 was 0.99 for extraction, discrimination, and detection. MAP values of Mask R-CNN for OCOR and OSAG image segmentation were 0.96 and 0.99. The accuracies of LeNet-5 in the diagnosis and classification were 0.94/0.94 (OCOR) and 0.92/0.91 (OSAG), respectively. The accuracy of the weighted models in the diagnosis and classification were 0.94 and 0.97, respectively. The accuracies of radiologists in the diagnosis and classification of labrum injuries ranged from 0.85 to 0.92 and 0.78 to 0.94, respectively.

Fire disaster can happen as a manmade disaster or even naturally, and it may cause environmental, social, and financial damages as well. In order to minimalize the unwanted fire calamity, early detection of fire eruptions coupled with immediate and effective response is extremely vital to disaster management systems. The classification of forest fire and non fire images using deep learning techniques has recently received popularity. Detection and prevention of forest fire have lot of significance from the perspective of the forest fire department, specially for the fire and arson investigators. There are shortcomings in the current mechanisms of forest fire detection in terms of accuracy. Hence, we propose a fire detection model using LeNet5 convolutional neural networks (CNN), which can spot fire in outdoor environments by classifying fire and non fire images. L2 regularization is critical technique that manipulates the complexity of the convolutional neural network model. In our work fire images have certain features that decide if the image is fire or non fire.A weight is assigned to every feature. Regularization used to help to reduce the over fitting that used to caused by plenty of weights. Our proposed provides the directiontowards developing a system that detects the early stages of forest fire.This model can further be utilized to prevent the damage caused by the fire. A CNN is a deep learning method, which has been adopted in order to detect the images of fire and non-fire. With the non sparse solution of L2 regularization we have obtained around 87% of train accuracy, 71% of validation accuracy and 70% of test accuracy after running 10 epochs.","[Roy, Sanjiban Sekhar; Goti, Vatsal; Sood, Aditya; Roy, Harsh] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Gavrila, Tania; Paraschiv, Nicolae] Petr Gas Univ Ploiesti, Ploiesti, Romania; [Gavrila, Tania] Aurel Vlaicu Univ Arad, Arad, Romania; [Floroian, Dan] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Brasov, Romania; [Mohammadi-Ivatloo, Behnam] Univ Tabriz, Fac Elect & Comp Engn, Tabriz, Iran",,"Roy, SS (corresponding author), Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India.",sanjibansroy@ieee.org,"Roy, Sanjiban Sekhar/T-4266-2019","Roy, Sanjiban Sekhar/0000-0003-2003-7882",,,,,38,0,0,1,1,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1064-1246,1875-8967,,J INTELL FUZZY SYST,J.

For energy cost-efficiency, developing low-power hardware for CNNs is a research trend. Due to the large input size, the first few convolutional layers generally consume most latency and hardware resources on hardware design. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative architecture named SLIT to extract feature maps and reconstruct the first few layers on CNNs. In this reconstruction approach, total multiply-accumulate operations are eliminated on the first layers. We evaluate new topology with MNIST, CIFAR, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets on image classification application. Latency and hardware resources of the inference step are evaluated on the chip ZC7Z020-1CLG484C FPGA with Lenet-5 and VGG schemes. On the Lenet-5 scheme, our architecture reduces 39% of latency and 70% of hardware resources with a 0.456 W power consumption compared to previous works. Even though the VGG models perform with a 10% reduction in hardware resources and latency, we hope our overall results will potentially give a new impetus for future studies to reach a higher optimization on hardware design. Notably, the SLIT architecture efficiently merges with most popular CNNs at a slightly sacrificing accuracy of a factor of 0.27% on MNIST, ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% on CIFAR, approximately 2.2% on ImageNet, and remaining the same on SVHN databases.","[Tran, Thi Diem; Nakashima, Yasuhiko] Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Ikoma 6300192, Japan",,"Tran, TD (corresponding author), Nara Inst Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Ikoma 6300192, Japan.",tran.thi_diem.tl4@is.naist.jp,,, [JP17H00730],,A part of this research is based on Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) JP17H00730.,,44,0,0,1,1,IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATION ENGINEERS,TOKYO,"KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG, 3-5-8, SHIBA-KOEN, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-0011, JAPAN",1745-1353,,,IEICE T ELECTRON,IEICE Trans.

After the process of chromosome selection, crossover and variation, the fitness value is calculated to present the superiority of the current chromosome. The chromosomes with high fitness values are more likely to be selected in the next genetic iteration, that is, the optimal hyperparameters of the CNN model are obtained.

The derived bio-carbons samples were extensively characterized using electron microscopy, surface area analysis, and CO2 adsorption capacity studies. As the activation temperature increased, the surface area, pore volume, nitrogen content, and the CO2 removal efficiency of the bio-carbons varied from 254 to 937 m(2)/g, 0.1241-0.4212 mL/g, 1.51-6.23%, and 2.11-5.48 mmol/g (at 25 degrees C under 3 bar pressure) respectively. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopic technique was used as a tool to understand the structural development that occurred in the biomasses during pyrolysis. Additionally, multivariate analysis such as combined Principal Component Analysis, partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was employed for the Raman data to discriminate the biomass based on their source and activation temperature. In addition, deep learning methods such as LeNET, ResNet, CAE were evaluated to classify the bio-carbon samples with respect to temperature and precursor material. All the models gave 100% accuracy of classification with respect to the temperature of activation. An overall classification accuracy of >92 +/- 0.0665% was obtained for LeNET model.

Therefore, control of resource usage and hardware optimization play an important role when we implement machine learning algorithms on an edge device. In this paper, we target convolutional neural networks (CNN) and explore various optimization and design techniques to realize them on FPGA devices. The key idea explored in this paper is Backward Pipeline Scheduling together with Latency Balancing which optimize the pipeline between CNN layers in order to significantly reduce the overall latency for processing a single image. We also develop a batch processing design to improve the throughput of the FPGA solution. We have achieved latency of 175.7 mu s for classifying one image in the MNIST data set using LeNet and 653.4 mu s for classifying one image in Cifar-10 data set using CifarNet. Without retraining, we are still able to maintain high accuracy of 97.6% for MNIST data set and 83.6% for the Cifar-10 data set.

Satellite cloud images of typhoons over the Northwest Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea from 1995-2020 are taken as samples. The results show that the classification accuracy of this model is 10.57% higher than that of the LeNet-5 model; the classification accuracy of the TICAENet model is 97.12%, with a classification precision of 97.00% for tropical storms, severe tropical storms and super typhoons.

Additionally, the model takes less memory and runs faster due to the weight sharing and multiple small kernels. The results show that the proposed model performs better than other methods.

CNN models are usually trained on high-performance computers and only the trained models are deployed to edge devices. But the statically trained model cannot adapt dynamically in a real environment and may result in low accuracy for new inputs. On-device training by learning from the real-world data after deployment can greatly improve accuracy. However, the high computation cost makes training prohibitive for resource-constrained devices. To tackle this problem, we explore the computational redundancies in training and reduce the computation cost by two complementary approaches: 1) self-supervised early instance filtering on data level and 2) error map pruning (EMP) on the algorithm level. The early instance filter selects important instances from the input stream to train the network and drops trivial ones. The EMP further prunes out insignificant computations when training with the selected instances. Extensive experiments show that the computation and energy cost is substantially reduced without any or with marginal accuracy loss. For example, when training ResNet-110 on CIFAR-10, we achieve 67.8% computation saving while preserving full accuracy and 75.1% computation saving with a marginal accuracy loss of 1.3%. When training LeNet on MNIST, we save 79% computation while boosting accuracy by 0.2%. Besides, practical energy saving is measured on edge platforms. We achieve 67.6% energy saving when training ResNet-110 on mobile GPU and 74.1% energy saving when training LeNet on MCU without any accuracy loss.","[Wu, Yawen; Wang, Zhepeng; Hu, Jingtong] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Shi, Yiyu] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",,"Wu, YW (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.",yawen.wu@pitt.edu; zhepeng.wang@pitt.edu; yshi4@nd.edu; jthu@pitt.edu,"Wang, Zhepeng/GPS-4667-2022","Wang, Zhepeng/0000-0002-1460-1128; Wu, Yawen/0000-0001-6840-267X",National Science Foundation [ACI-1548562]; NSF at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) [ACI-1445606]; University of Pittsburgh Center for Research Computing,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Pittsburgh Center for Research Computing,"This work used the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), which is supported by National Science Foundation grant number ACI-1548562.

This relearning procedure is a key component in deciding the time taken in building a hardware-friendly architecture. This paper analyses the fine-tuning or retraining step after pruning the network layer-wise and derives lower bounds for the number of epochs the network will take based on the amount of pruning done. Analyses on the propagation of errors through the layers while pruning layer-wise is also performed and a new parameter named 'Net Deviation' is proposed which can be used to estimate how good a pruning algorithm is. This parameter could be an alternative to 'test accuracy' that is normally used. Net Deviation can be calculated while pruning, using the same data that was used in the pruning procedure. Similar to the test accuracy degradation for different amounts of pruning, the net deviation curves help compare the pruning methods. As an example, a comparison between Random pruning, Weight magnitude based pruning and Clustered pruning is performed on LeNet-300-100 and LeNet-5 architectures using Net Deviation. Results indicate clustered pruning to be a better option than random approach, for higher compression.","[John, Soumya Sara; Mishra, Deepak; Rani, J.

Recent studies have demonstrated that hardware faults induced by an external perturbation or aging effects, may significantly impact the CNN inference, leading to prediction failures. Therefore, ensuring the reliability of CNN platforms is crucial, especially when deployed in critical applications. A lot of effort has been made to reduce the memory and energy footprint of CNNs, paving the way to the adoption of approximate computing techniques such as quantization, reduced precision, weight sharing, and pruning. Unfortunately, approximate computing reduces the intrinsic redundancy of CNNs making them more efficient but less resilient to hardware faults. The goal of this work is twofold. First, we assess the reliability of a CNN when reduced bit widths and two different data types (floating-and fixed-point) are used to represent the network parameters (i.e., synaptic weights). Second, we intend to investigate the best compromise between data type, bit-widths reduction, and reliability. The characterization is performed through a fault injection environment built on the darknet open-source framework and targets two CNNs: LeNet-5 and YOLO. Experimental results show that fixed-point data provide the best trade-off between memory footprint reduction and CNN resilience. In particular, for LeNet-5, we achieved a 4X memory footprint reduction at the cost of a slightly reduced reliability (0.45% of critical faults) without retraining the CNN.","[Ruospo, Annachiara; Sanchez, Ernesto] DAUIN Politecn Torino, Turin, Italy; [Traiola, Marcello; O'Connor, Ian; Bosio, Alberto] Univ Lyon, ECL, INSA Lyon, CNRS,UCBL,CPE Lyon,INL,UMR5270, Lyon, France",,"Ruospo, A (corresponding author), DAUIN Politecn Torino, Turin, Italy.",annachiara.ruospo@polito.it; ernesto.sanchez@polito.it; marcello.traiola@ec-lyon.fr; ian.connor@ec-lyon.fr; alberto.bosio@ec-lyon.fr,"Traiola, Marcello/Y-4890-2019","Traiola, Marcello/0000-0003-1484-5162; RUOSPO, ANNACHIARA/0000-0003-2040-9762",,,,,43,3,3,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0141-9331,1872-9436,,MICROPROCESS MICROSY,Microprocess.

On account of the limitations of traditional fault diagnosis in the dependence on expert experience knowledge and the extraction of fault features, it is of great meaning to explore the intelligent diagnosis methods of hydraulic piston pump. Motivated by deep learning theory, a novel intelligent fault diagnosis method for hydraulic piston pump is proposed via combining wavelet analysis with improved convolutional neural network (CNN). Compared with the classic AlexNet, the proposed method decreases the number of parameters and computational complexity by means of modifying the structure of network. The constructed model fully integrates the ability of wavelet analysis in feature extraction and the ability of CNN in deep learning. The proposed method is employed to extract the fault features from the measured vibration signals of the piston pump and realize the fault classification. The fault data are mainly from five different health states: central spring failure, sliding slipper wear, swash plate wear, loose slipper, and normal state, respectively. The results show that the proposed method can extract the characteristics of the vibration signals of the piston pump in multiple states, and effectively realize intelligent fault recognition. To further demonstrate the recognition property of the proposed model, different CNN models are used for comparisons, involving standard LeNet-5, improved 2D LeNet-5, and standard AlexNet. Compared with the models for contrastive analysis, the proposed method has the highest recognition accuracy, and the proposed model is more robust.","[Zhu, Yong; Li, Guangpeng; Wang, Rui; Tang, Shengnan; Su, Hong; Cao, Kai] Jiangsu Univ, Natl Res Ctr Pumps, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yong] Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab Fluid Power & Mechatron Syst, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yong] Ningbo Acad Prod & Food Qual Inspect, Ningbo 315048, Peoples R China",,"Li, GP (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Natl Res Ctr Pumps, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhuyong@ujs.edu.cn; 2221911015@stmail.ujs.edu.cn; 2221911023@stmail.ujs.edu.cn; 2111811013@stmail.ujs.edu.cn; 2222011046@stmail.ujs.edu.cn; 2222011002@stmail.ujs.edu.cn,"tang, shengnan/GQI-0751-2022","tang, shengnan/0000-0002-6417-0143; Zhu, Yong/0000-0001-6217-088X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51805214]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFB2005204, 2020YFC1512402]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M651722]; Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [ZJ2020090]; Ningbo Natural Science Foundation [202003N4034]; Open Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power and Mechatronic Systems [GZKF-201905]; Youth Talent Development Program of Jiangsu University",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Ningbo Natural Science Foundation; Open Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power and Mechatronic Systems; Youth Talent Development Program of Jiangsu University,"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51805214), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2019YFB2005204, 2020YFC1512402), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2019M651722), Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (ZJ2020090), Ningbo Natural Science Foundation (202003N4034), Open Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power and Mechatronic Systems (GZKF-201905), and the Youth Talent Development Program of Jiangsu University.",,54,13,13,15,43,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JAN,2021.0,21,2,,,,,,,549,10.3390/s21020549,0.0,,,18,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,PX9YN,33466697.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000611707500001,0

In recent years, numerous researchers have implemented techniques to recognize handwritten characters using optical character recognition (OCR) approaches for many languages. One the most common methods to improve the OCR accuracy is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A CNN model contains several kernels accompanying with pooling layers and nonlinear functions. This model overcomes the problem of adjusting the value of weights and interconnections of the neural network (NN) for creating an appropriate pipeline to process the spatial and temporal information. However, the training process of a CNN is a challenging issue. Various optimization strategies have been recently utilized for optimizing CNN's biases and weights such as firefly algorithm (FA) and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms. In this study, we apply a well-known nature-inspired technique called chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA) to train a classical CNN structure LeNet-5 for Persian/Arabic handwritten recognition. The proposed method is tested on two known and publicly available handwritten word datasets. To deeply investigate and evaluate the approach, the results are compared with three optimization methods including ACO, FA, and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Outcomes indicated that the proposed ChOA technique considerably improves the performance of the original LeNet model and also shows a better performance than the others.","[Khosravi, Sara; Chalechale, Abdolah] Razi Univ, Dept Comp Engn & Informat Technol, Kermanshah, Iran",,"Chalechale, A (corresponding author), Razi Univ, Dept Comp Engn & Informat Technol, Kermanshah, Iran.",khosravi_un@yahoo.com; chalechale@razi.ac.ir,"Khosravi, Sara/CAJ-5836-2022","Khosravi, Sara/0000-0003-0182-2877",,,,,65,0,0,3,3,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1024-123X,1563-5147,,MATH PROBL ENG,Math.

Detection of COVID-19 and pneumonia by the chest X-ray images is of great significance to control the development of the epidemic situation. The current COVID-19 and pneumonia detection system may suffer from two shortcomings: the selection of hyperparameters in the models is not appropriate, and the generalization ability of the model is poor. Method: To solve the above problems, our team proposed an improved intelligent global optimization algorithm, which is based on the biogeography-based optimization to automatically optimize the hyperparameters value of the models according to different detection objectives. In the optimization progress, after selecting the immigration of suitable index vector and the emigration of suitable index vector, we proposed adding a comparison operation to compare the value of them. According to the different numerical relationships between them, the corresponding operations are performed to improve the migration operation of biogeography-based optimization. The improved algorithm (momentum factor biogeography-based optimization) can better perform the automatic optimization operation. In addition, our team also proposed two frameworks: biogeography convolutional neural network and momentum factor biogeography convolutional neural network. And two methods for detection COVID-19 based on the proposed frameworks. Results: Our method used three convolutional neural networks (LeNet-5, VGG-16, and ResNet-18) as the basic classification models for chest X-ray images detection of COVID-19, Normal, and Pneumonia. The accuracy of LeNet-5, VGG-16, and ResNet-18 is improved by 1.56%, 1.48%, and 0.73% after using biogeography-based optimization to optimize the hyperparameters of the models. The accuracy of LeNet-5, VGG-16, and ResNet-18 is improved by 2.87%, 6.31%, and 1.46% after using the momentum factor biogeography-based optimization to optimize the hyperparameters of the models. Conclusion: Under the same experimental conditions, the performance of the momentum factor biogeography-based optimization is superior to the biogeography-based optimization in optimizing the hyperparameters of the convolutional neural networks. Experimental results show that the momentum factor biogeography-based optimization can improve the detection performance of the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of overall accuracy. In future research, we will continue to use and improve other global optimization algorithms to enhance the application ability of deep learning in medical pathological image detection.

Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM)-based computing system provides a promising solution to energy-efficient neural network training. However, it's difficult to support high-precision CNN in RRAM-based hardware systems. Firstly, multi-bit digital-analog interfaces will take up most energy overhead of the whole system. Secondly, it's difficult to write the RRAM to expected resistance states accurately; only low-precision numbers can be represented. To enable CNN training based on RRAM, we propose a low-bitwidth CNN training method, using low-bitwidth convolution outputs (CO), activations (A), weights (W) and gradients (G) to train CNN models based on RRAM. Furthermore, we design a system to implement the training algorithms. We explore the accuracy under different bitwidth combinations of (A, CO, WG), and propose a practical tradeoff between accuracy and energy overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed system perform well on low-bitwidth CNN training tasks. For example, training LeNet-5 with 4-bit convolution outputs, 4-bit weights, 4-bit activations and 4-bit gradients on MNIST can still achieve 97.67% accuracy. Moreover, the proposed system can achieve 23.0X higher energy efficiency than GPU when processing the training task of LeNet-5, and 4.4X higher energy efficiency when processing the training task of ResNet-20.","[Cai, Yi; Tang, Tianqi; Xia, Lixue; Cheng, Ming; Zhu, Zhenhua; Wang, Yu; Yang, Huazhong] Tsinghua Univ, Dept EE, Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol TNList, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept EE, Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol TNList, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yu-wang@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,"WANG, Yu/B-7985-2011","WANG, Yu/0000-0001-6108-5157; Xia, Lixue/0000-0002-7731-7028","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61373026, 61622403, 61621091]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0207600]; Huawei Technologies Co.

It represents a unique method for image processing, object detection, and classification. CNN has shown to be an efficient approach in the machine learning and computer vision fields. CNN is composed of several filters accompanied by nonlinear functions and pooling layers. It enforces limitations on the weights and interconnections of the neural network to create a good structure for processing spatial and temporal distributed data. A CNN can restrain the numbering of free parameters of the network through its weight-sharing property. However, the training of CNNs is a challenging approach. Some optimization techniques have been recently employed to optimize CNN's weight and biases such as Ant Colony Optimization, Genetic, Harmony Search, and Simulated Annealing. This paper employs the well-known nature-inspired algorithm called Shuffled Frog-Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) for training a classical CNN structure (LeNet-5), which has not been experienced before. The training method is investigated by employing four different datasets. To verify the study, the results are compared with some of the most famous evolutionary trainers: Whale Optimization Algorithm (WO), Bacteria Swarm Foraging Optimization (BFSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The outcomes demonstrate that the SFL technique considerably improves the performance of the original LeNet-5 although using this algorithm slightly increases the training computation time. The results also demonstrate that the suggested algorithm presents high accuracy in classification and approximation in its mechanism.","[Saadi, Soroush Baseri] Catholic Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Fac Med, Leuven, Belgium; [Sarshar, Nazanin Tataei] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Engn, Tehran North Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Sadeghi, Soroush] Univ Tehran, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Ranjbarzadeh, Ramin; Bendechache, Malika] Dublin City Univ, Fac Engn & Comp, Sch Comp, Dublin, Ireland; [Forooshani, Mersedeh Kooshki] Polytech Univ, Dept Elect & Telecommun, Turin, Italy",,"Sarshar, NT (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Engn, Tehran North Branch, Tehran, Iran.",ab.tataee@gmail.com,"Ranjbarzadeh, Ramin/E-7289-2019","Ranjbarzadeh, Ramin/0000-0001-7065-9060; Bendechache, Malika/0000-0003-0069-1860",,,,,77,1,1,1,1,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",2040-2295,2040-2309,,J HEALTHC ENG,J.

A new Agile convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to conquer the challenges of a small-scale medical image database and the small size of the nodules, and it improves the performance of pulmonary nodule classification using CT images. A hybrid CNN of LeNet and AlexNet is constructed through combining the layer settings of LeNet and the parameter settings of AlexNet. A dataset with 743 CT image nodule samples is built up based on the 1018 CT scans of LIDC to train and evaluate the Agile CNN model. Through adjusting the parameters of the kernel size, learning rate, and other factors, the effect of these parameters on the performance of the CNN model is investigated, and an optimized setting of the CNN is obtained finally. After finely optimizing the settings of the CNN, the estimation accuracy and the area under the curve can reach 0.822 and 0.877, respectively. The accuracy of the CNN is significantly dependent on the kernel size, learning rate, training batch size, dropout, and weight initializations. The best performance is achieved when the kernel size is set to , the learning rate is 0.005, the batch size is 32, and dropout and Gaussian initialization are used. This competitive performance demonstrates that our proposed CNN framework and the optimization strategy of the CNN parameters are suitable for pulmonary nodule classification characterized by small medical datasets and small targets.

Conventional morphological features are defined based on qualitative descriptions or manually selected indicators, which include subjective bias, thus limiting generalizability. The lack of public architectural morphological datasets also leads to setbacks in data-driven morphological analysis. This study proposed a new method for generating topology-based synthetic data via a rule-based system and for encoding morphological information to promote morphological classification via deep learning. A deep convolution network, LeNet, which was modified in the output layer, was trained with synthetic data, including five spatial prototypes (central, linear, radial, cluster, and grid). The performance of the proposed method was validated on 40 practical architectural layouts. Compared to the ground truth, the proposed method provided an encouraging accuracy of 97.5% (39/40). Interestingly, the most possible mistakes of the LeNet were also understandable according to the architect's intuitive perception. The proposed method considered the statistical and overall characteristics of the training samples. This work demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the deep learning network trained with synthetic architectural patterns for morphological classification in practical architectural layouts. The findings of this work could serve as a basis for further morpho-topology studies and other social, building energy, and building structure studies related to spatial morphology.

Given a trained CNN model, connections were divided into groups in a group-wise way according to their corresponding output neurons. All connections with their cross-entropy errors below a grouping threshold were then removed. A sparse model was obtained and the number of parameters in the baseline model significantly reduced. This letter also presents a highest cross-entropy pruning (HCEP) method that keeps a small portion of weights with the highest CEP. This method further improves the accuracy of CEP. To validate CEP, we conducted the experiments on low redundant networks that are hard to compress. For the MNIST data set, CEP achieves an 0.08% accuracy drop required by LeNet-5 benchmark with only 16% of original parameters. Our proposed CEP also reduces approximately 75% of the storage cost of AlexNet on the ILSVRC 2012 data set, increasing the top-1 errorby only 0.4% and top-5 error by only 0.2%. Compared with three existing methods on LeNet-5, our proposed CEP and HCEP perform significantly better than the existing methods in terms of the accuracy and stability.

Depending on the given optimization goals such as power consumption or performance, there may be several optimal solutions for each scenario. A commonly used method for finding these solutions as early as possible in the design cycle, is the employment of analytical models which try to describe a design by simple yet insightful and sufficiently accurate formulas. The main contribution of this work is the generic Analytical Model for AI accelerators (AMAIX) for the estimation of CNN execution time on DLAs. It is based on the popular Roofline model. To show the validity of our approach, AMAIX was applied to the Nvidia Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA) as a case study using the AlexNet and LeNet CNNs as workloads. The resulting performance predictions were verified against an RTL emulation of the NVDLA using a Synopsys ZeBu Server-based hybrid prototype.

Deep learning tasks are executed to obtain effective information in the user data. However, the edge nodes are heterogeneous and the network bandwidth is limited in this case, which will cause general distributed deep learning to be inefficient. In this paper, we propose Group Synchronous Parallel (GSP), which uses a density-based algorithm to group edge nodes with similar training speeds together. In order to eliminate stragglers, group parameter servers are responsible for coordinating communication of nodes in the group with Stale Synchronous Parallel and aggregating the gradients of these nodes. And a global parameter server is responsible for aggregating the gradients from the group parameter servers to update the global model. To save network bandwidth, we further propose Grouping Dynamic Sparsification (GDS). It adjusts the gradient sparsification rate of nodes dynamically based on GSP so as to differentiates the communication volume and makes the training speed of all nodes tend to be the same. We evaluate GSP and GDS's performance on LeNet-5, ResNet, VGG, and Seq2Seq with Attention. The experimental results show that GSP speedups the training by 45% similar to 120% with 16 nodes. GDS on top of GSP can make up for some test accuracy loss, up to 0.82% for LeNet-5.","[Gui, Zhiyi; Yang, Xiang; Li, Wei; Zhang, Lei; Qi, Qi; Wang, Jingyu; Sun, Haifeng; Liao, Jianxin] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hao] Huawei, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Gui, ZY (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",guizhiyi@bupt.edu.cn; yangxiang@bupt.edu.cn; yanghao30@huawei.com; liwei@bupt.edu.cn; zhanglei@bupt.edu.cn; qiqi8266@bupt.edu.cn; wangjingyu@bupt.edu.cn; hfsun@bupt.edu.cn; liaojx@bupt.edu.cn,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2158-9178,,978-1-6654-3574-1,IEEE INT SYMP PARAL,,,2021.0,,,,,,,429,436,,10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom52081.2021.00066,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BS7TL,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000766837400051,0

The improvement of the cure rate and prognosis of bladder tumor depends on the accurate recognition of bladder tumor under the cystoscope. Aims To verify that deep learning technology can identify bladder cancer images. Materials and Methods In this study, 1200 cystoscopic cancer images from 224 patients with bladder cancer and 1150 cystoscopic images from 221 patients with no bladder cancer were collected. Three convolutional neural networks (LeNet, AlexNet and GoogLeNet), and the EasyDL deep learning platform were used to train deep learning models to distinguish images of bladder cancer. The diagnostic efficiency of deep learning model and urology experts was compared. Results The efficiency of EasyDL was the highest, and the accuracy was 96.9%. The efficiency of GoogLeNet was the second highest, and the accuracy was 92.54%. Among the 33 bladder cancer nodes and 11 no bladder cancer nodes, the accuracy of the neural network was 83.36% and that of medical experts was 84.09% (p > 0.05). Discussion This study used convolutional neural networks to recognize bladder tumor in the clinical. Although these three networks (LeNet, AlexNet and GoogLeNet) had a relatively basic network architecture, they achieved good results in the classification task of cystoscopic images. The deep learning system had a recognition efficiency no less than that of experienced clinical experts.

Therefore, the near-infrared spectroscopy classification modeling method based on CNN was studied in this paper. Taking into account the characteristics of near-infrared spectral data, an improved CNN modeling method was presented in this paper, which improves the CNN classical model Lenet-5 : (1) The square matrix convolution kernel was transformed into a vector convolution kernel for one-dimensional near-infrared spectroscopy. (2) The C5, F6 and output layers of the lenet-5 structure were changed to single-layer sensing machines in order to simplify the network structure. At the same time, the method of sampling points was used to reduce the dimensionality of near infrared spectrum and speed up the convergence rate. The influence of convolution kernel size on modeling results was also studied in this paper. NIR-CNN model was established by the near-infrared spectroscopy of 600 central tobacco samples from northeast, Huanghuai and southwest China. The accuracy of the model was 98. 2% and 95% for the training set and test set. The experimental results showed that the application of CNN could accurately and reliably identify the near infrared spectrum data. This method provided guidance for the scientific and rational utilization of raw materials of tobacco enterprises, and it was important to maintain the quality stability of cigarette products. The method of near infrared spectroscopy based on CNN could also be applied in the classification of other agricultural products.","[Lu Meng-yao; Yang Yu-qing; Liu Hui; Li Jun-hui; Zhao Long-lian; Zhang Ye-hui] China Agr Univ, Coll Informat & Elect Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Yang Kai; Shu Ru-xin] Technol Ctr Shanghai Tobacco Grp Gorporat, Shanghai 200082, Peoples R China; [Song Peng-fei; Wang Luo-ping] Yunnan Tobacco Technol Ctr, Kunming 650202, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Lu Meng-yao; Yang Yu-qing; Liu Hui; Li Jun-hui; Zhao Long-lian; Zhang Ye-hui] China Agr Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Modern Precis Agr Syst Integrat Res, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,"Li, JH (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Informat & Elect Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;Li, JH (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Modern Precis Agr Syst Integrat Res, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",498408325@qq.com; caunir@cau.edu.cn,,,,,,,13,10,13,17,71,OFFICE SPECTROSCOPY & SPECTRAL ANALYSIS,BEIJING,"NO 76 COLLAGE SOUTH RD BEIJING, BEIJING 100081, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-0593,,,SPECTROSC SPECT ANAL,Spectrosc.

We present a novel efficient Fourier convolutional neural network, where a new activation function is used, the additional shift Fourier transformation process is eliminated, and the number of learnable parameters is reduced. First, the Phase Rectified Linear Unit (PhaseReLU) is proposed, which is equivalent to the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) in the spatial domain. Second, in the proposed Fourier network, the shift Fourier transform is removed since the process is inessential for training. Lastly, we introduce two ways of reducing the number of weight parameters in the Fourier network. The basic method is to use a three-by-three sized kernel instead of five-by-five in our proposed Fourier convolutional neural network. We use the random kernel in our efficient Fourier convolutional neural network, whose standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is used as a weight parameter. In other words, since only two scalars for each imaginary and real component per channel are required, a very small number of parameters is applied compressively. Therefore, as a result of experimenting in shallow networks, such as LeNet-3 and LeNet-5, our method achieves competitive accuracy with conventional convolutional neural networks while dramatically reducing the number of parameters. Furthermore, our proposed Fourier network, using a basic three-by-three kernel, mostly performs with higher accuracy than traditional convolutional neural networks in shallow and deep neural networks. Our experiments represent that presented kernel methods have the potential to be applied in all architecture based on convolutional neural networks.","[Han, Yuna; Hong, Byung-Woo] Chung Ang Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Seoul 156756, South Korea",,"Hong, BW (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",yuna@image.cau.ac.kr; hong@cau.ac.kr,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017R1A2B4 006023, NRF-2019K1A3A1A77074958, NRF-2020K2A9A2A06026659]; Korea government (MSIT) [IITP-2021-0-01341]; Artificial Intelligence Graduate School, Chung-Ang University; High-Potential Individuals Global Training Program [IITP-2021-0-01574]","National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korea government (MSIT)(Korean Government); Artificial Intelligence Graduate School, Chung-Ang University; High-Potential Individuals Global Training Program","This research was funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea: NRF-2017R1A2B4 006023, NRF-2019K1A3A1A77074958, NRF-2020K2A9A2A06026659 and by the Korea government (MSIT): IITP-2021-0-01341, Artificial Intelligence Graduate School, Chung-Ang University and IITP-2021-0-01574, High-Potential Individuals Global Training Program.",,38,8,8,3,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-9292,,ELECTRONICS-SWITZ,Electronics,AUG,2021.0,10,16,,,,,,,2004,10.3390/electronics10162004,0.0,,,19,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Physics,UF8XC,,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000688850200001,0

Previous work demonstrated that CNNs can be converted into equivalent Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs) without obvious accuracy loss, including different functional layers such as Convolutional (Conv), Fully Connected (FC), Avg-pooling, Max-pooling, and Batch-Normalization (BN) layers. To reduce inference-latency, existing researches mainly concentrated on the normalization of weights to increase the firing rate of neurons. There are also some approaches during training phase or altering the network architecture. However, little attention has been paid on the end of inference phase. From this new perspective, this paper presents 4 stopping criterions as low-cost plug-ins to reduce the inference-latency of SCNNs. The proposed methods are validated using MATLAB and PyTorch platforms with Spiking-AlexNet for CIFAR-10 dataset and Spiking-LeNet-5 for MNIST dataset. Simulation results reveal that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can shorten the average inference-latency of Spiking-AlexNet from 892 to 267 time steps (almost 3.34 times faster) with the accuracy decline from 87.95 to 87.72%. With our methods, 4 types of Spiking-LeNet-5 only need 24-70 time steps per image with the accuracy decline not more than 0.1%, while models without our methods require 52-138 time steps, almost 1.92 to 3.21 times slower than us.</p>","[Chen, Xuan; Yuan, Xiaopeng; Fu, Gaoming; Luo, Yuanyong; Yue, Tao; Yan, Feng; Wang, Yuxuan; Pan, Hongbing] Nanjing Univ, Sch Elect Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China",,"Pan, HB (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Elect Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",phb@nju.edu.cn,,"Luo, Yuanyong/0000-0002-4450-066X",,,,,43,0,0,1,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1662-5188,,FRONT COMPUT NEUROSC,Front.

Therefore, this article proposes an automatic tomato leaf disease identification system using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture powered by crossover-based wind-driven optimization (CROWDO) algorithm. This method helps to improve the classification accuracy of tomato leaf disease when compared to the existing supervised machine learning algorithms. Here, the CROWDO approach is used to improve the accuracy of the pre-trained AlexNet architecture to reduce overfitting, training time, and excessive energy consumption. The proposed model is capable of identifying four tomato leaf diseases (Leaf Mold, Early Blight, Target Spot, and tomato Yellow Leaf Curl) and the leaf damage caused by two-spotted spider mites. The experimental analysis has been performed, and the results demonstrated that the CROWDO-optimized AlexNet architecture for tomato leaf disease classification outperforms various pre-trained such as VGG16, GoogleNet, SqueezeNet, and LeNet by the accuracy of 99.86%. The time taken for training our proposed CROWDO-optimized AlexNet architecture was 12.3654 s which is relatively less than the time taken by other pre-trained architectures such as LeNet, VGGNet, SqueezeNet, and GoogleNet in terms of seconds. The proposed CROWDO-optimized AlexNet architecture not only improves classification accuracy but also assisted the farmers in identifying the area of disease and pest infestation in real-time, as well as meeting real-time detection accuracy standards.","[Thanammal Indu, V.] Amrita Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Nagercoil, India; [Suja Priyadharsini, S.] Anna Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Reg Campus Tirunelveli, Tirunelveli, India",,"Indu, VT (corresponding author), Amrita Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Nagercoil, India.",vthanammalindu@gmail.com,,"V, Thanammal Indu/0000-0001-8466-8443",,,,,52,3,3,3,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1861-3829,1861-3837,,J PLANT DIS PROTECT,J.

Artificial intelligence research is rising, focusing on automated emotion detection. The capability to identify the emotion, which is considered one of the traits of emotional intelligence, is a component of human intelligence. Although the study is limited dependent on facial expressions or voice is flourishing, it is identifying emotions via body movements, a less researched issue. To attain emotional intelligence, this study suggests a deep learning approach. Here initially the video can be converted into image frames after the converted image frames can be preprocessed using the Glitter bandpass butter worth filter and contrast stretch histogram equalization. Then from the enhanced image, the features can be clustered using the hybrid Gaussian BIRCH algorithm. Then the specialized features are retrieved from the body of human gestures using the AdaDelta bacteria foraging optimization algorithm, and the selected features are fed to a supervised Kernel Boosting LENET deep-learning algorithm. The experiment is conducted using Geneva multimodal emotion portrayals (GEMEPs) corpus data set. This data set includes, human body gestures portraying the archetypes of five emotions, such as anger, fear, joy, pride, and sad. In these emotion detection techniques, the suggested Kernel Boosting LENET classifier achieves 98.5% accuracy, 94% precision, 95% sensitivity, and F-Score 93% outperformed better than the other existing classifiers. As a result, emotional acknowledgment may help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to improve their performance and entrepreneurial orientation. The correlation coefficient of 188 and the significance coefficient of 0.00 show that emotional intelligence and SMEs performance have a significant and positive association.","[Serbaya, Suhail H.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia",,"Serbaya, SH (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.",sserbaya@kau.edu.sa,"Serbaya, Suhail/GNH-3427-2022","Serbaya, Suhail/0000-0003-0541-0511",,,,,41,0,0,1,1,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1939-0114,1939-0122,,SECUR COMMUN NETW,Secur.

The performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is particularly outstanding. CNNs, however, are usually computationally intensive, which hinders the deployment of CNNs in resource-limited devices. Methods of network compression, pruning methods in particularly, removing redundant structures of CNNs, can significantly reduce the computational complexity of CNNs. Most of the state-of-the-art pruning methods for CNNs, however, have two defects. (1) Filters, also called convolutional kernels that are matrices used to extract features in an image, are pruned by ranking their weight without considering the effects of their actual output, which results in the deletion of important filters and the difficulty in determining the pruning threshold on weight. (2) Filters are pruned either in the forward direction or in isolation, which are difficult to control the loss of accuracy. This paper proposes a novel pruning method called filter similarity analysis with backward pruning (FSABP). FSABP calculates the similarity coefficients of filters in each layer, and deletes the filters associated with small similarity coefficients. The smaller the coefficient the more similar the filters. Filters are pruned layer by layer in the backward direction starting from the last convolution layer, which can effectively control the loss of accuracy by avoiding early removal of the shallow convolution filters. Experiments on LENET, VGG-16 and ResNet-50 show that FSABP can reduce parameter redundancy at the cost of negligible loss of accuracy and even improve accuracy in some cases. The results on LENET also suggest that FSABP is applicable to both deep and shallow CNNs.","[Geng, Lili; Niu, Baoning] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Sch Informat & Comp, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Geng, Lili] Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Expt Ctr, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China",,"Geng, LL (corresponding author), Taiyuan Univ Technol, Sch Informat & Comp, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China.;Geng, LL (corresponding author), Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Expt Ctr, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China.",genglily@163.com; niubaoning@tyut.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Plan of China [2017YFB1401000]; National Key Research and Development Plan of Shanxi Provence [201903D421007],National Key Research and Development Plan of China; National Key Research and Development Plan of Shanxi Provence,This work was supported by National Key Research and Development Plan of China No. 2017YFB1401000 and National Key Research and Development Plan of Shanxi Provence No. 201903D421007.,,24,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-6125,1573-0565,,MACH LEARN,Mach.

However, their fixed architecture, substantial training cost, and significant model redundancy make it difficult to efficiently update them to accommodate previously unseen data. To solve these problems, we propose an incremental learning framework based on a grow-and-prune neural network synthesis paradigm. When new data arrive, the neural network first grows new connections based on the gradients to increase the network capacity to accommodate new data. Then, the framework iteratively prunes away connections based on the magnitude of weights to enhance network compactness, and hence recover efficiency. Finally, the model rests at a lightweight DNN that is both ready for inference and suitable for future grow- and-prune updates. The proposed framework improves accuracy, shrinks network size, and significantly reduces the additional training cost for incoming data compared to conventional approaches, such as training from scratch and network fine-tuning. For the LeNet-300-100 (LeNet-5) neural network architectures derived for the MNIST dataset, the framework reduces training cost by up to 64 (67), 63 (63), and 69 (73 percent) compared to training from scratch, network fine-tuning, and grow-and-prune from scratch, respectively. For the ResNet-18 architecture derived for the ImageNet dataset (DeepSpeech2 for the AN4 dataset), the corresponding training cost reductions against training from scratch, network fine-tunning, and grow-and-prune from scratch are 64 (67), 60 (62), and 72 (71 percent), respectively. Our derived models contain fewer network parameters but achieve higher accuracy relative to conventional baselines.","[Dai, Xiaoliang; Yin, Hongxu; Jha, Niraj K.] Princeton Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Dai, XL (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",xdai@princeton.edu,,"Yin, Hongxu/0000-0002-6481-6389",NSF [CNS-1617640],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by NSF Grant No. CNS-1617640.,,45,1,1,1,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-6750,,,IEEE T EMERG TOP COM,IEEE Trans.

Recent research uses the deep convolution neural network (DCNN) as the discoverer or classifier of COVID-19 X-ray images. The most challenging part of neural networks is the subject of their training. Descent-based (GDB) algorithms have long been used to train fullymconnected layer (FCL) at DCNN. Despite the ability of GDBs to run and converge quickly in some applications, their disadvantage is the manual adjustment of many parameters. Therefore, it is not easy to parallelize them with graphics processing units (GPUs). Therefore, in this paper, the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) evolved by a fuzzy system called FuzzyWOA is proposed for DCNN training. With accurate and appropriate tuning of WOA's control parameters, the fuzzy system defines the boundary between the exploration and extraction phases in the search space. It causes the development and upgrade of WOA. To evaluate the performance and capability of the proposed DCNN-FuzzyWOA model, a publicly available database called COVID-Xray-5k is used. DCNN-PSO, DCNN-GA, and LeNet-5 benchmark models are used for fair comparisons. Comparative parameters include accuracy, processing time, standard deviation (STD), curves of ROC and precision-recall, and F1-Score. The results showed that the FuzzyWOA training algorithm with 20 epochs was able to achieve 100% accuracy, at a processing time of 880.44 s with an F1-Score equal to 100%. Structurally, the i-6c-2s-12c-2s model achieved better results than the i-8c-2s-16c-2s model. However, the results of using FuzzyWOA for both models have been very encouraging compared to particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, and LeNet-5 methods.","[Saffari, Abbas; Khishe, Mohammad] Imam Khomeini Marine Sci Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Nowshahr, Iran; [Mohammadi, Mokhtar] Lebanese French Univ, Coll Engn & Comp Sci, Dept Informat Technol, Erbil, Kurdistan Reg, Iraq; [Mohammed, Adil Hussein] Cihan Univ Erbil, Fac Engn, Dept Commun & Comp Engn, Erbil, Kurdistan Reg, Iraq; [Rashidi, Shima] Univ Human Dev, Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Sulaymaniyah, Kurdistan Reg, Iraq",,"Saffari, A (corresponding author), Imam Khomeini Marine Sci Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Nowshahr, Iran.",abbas.saffari@birjand.ac.ir; m_khishe@alumni.iust.ac.ir; mukhtar@lfu.edu.krd; adil.husseinmohammed@hotmail.com; shima.rashidi@hotmail.com,"Saffari, Abbas/AGQ-8012-2022","Saffari, Abbas/0000-0001-6679-7225; Mohammed, Adil/0000-0002-6531-2051; Khishe, Mohammad/0000-0002-1024-8822",,,,,37,0,0,1,1,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-5265,1687-5273,,COMPUT INTEL NEUROSC,Comput.

There is an ever-increasing need to establish accurate georeferencing techniques for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for tasks like aerial surveyance of mines/construction sites, change detection along national highways, inspection of major pipelines, intelligent farming, among others. With this paper, we aim to establish a standard method of georeferencing by proposing the design of a simple, white colored, L-shaped marker along with the pipeline for its detection. In a first, the less common DRGB color space is used along with the RGB color space to segment the characteristic white color of the marker. To carry out recognition, a scale and rotation invariant modification of the edge oriented histogram is used. To allow for accurate histograms, improvements are made on canny edge detection using adaptive approaches and exploiting contour properties. The histogram obtained displayed a characteristic distribution of peaks for GCP-markers. Thus, a new peak-detection and verification methodology is also proposed based on the normalized cross-correlation. Finally, a CNN model is trained on the Regions of Interest around the GCP-markers that are received after the filtering. The results from EOH and CNN were then used for classification.

To address this issue, a phase-only hologram generation algorithm based on depth learning and angular-spectrum layer-oriented, which can generate holograms quickly and improve the quality of hologram reconstruction, is proposed. The LeNet network structure predicts the complex amplitude information of three-dimensional objects, which reduces the amount of calculation. The accurate angular-spectrum algorithm creates a high-quality phase-only hologram of a three-dimensional object.

However, inference with large-scale full-precision CNNs must cause substantial energy consumption and memory occupation, which seriously hinders their deployment on mobile and embedded systems. Highly inspired from biological brain, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are emerging as new solutions because of natural superiority in brain-like learning and great energy efficiency with event-driven communication and computation. Nevertheless, training a deep SNN remains a main challenge and there is usually a big accuracy gap between ANNs and SNNs. In this paper, we introduce a hardware-friendly conversion algorithm called scatter-and-gather to convert quantized ANNs to lossless SNNs, where neurons are connected with ternary {-1,0,1} synaptic weights. Each spiking neuron is stateless and more like original McCulloch and Pitts model, because it fires at most one spike and need be reset at each time step. Furthermore, we develop an incremental mapping framework to demonstrate efficient network deployments on a reconfigurable neuromorphic chip. Experimental results show our spiking LeNet on MNIST and VGG-Net on CIFAR-10 datasetobtain 99.37% and 91.91% classification accuracy, respectively. Besides, the presented mapping algorithm manages network deployment on our neuromorphic chip with maximum resource efficiency and excellent flexibility. Our four-spike LeNet and VGG-Net on chip can achieve respective real-time inference speed of 0.38 ms/image, 3.24 ms/image, and an average power consumption of 0.28 mJ/image and 2.3 mJ/image at 0.9 V, 252 MHz, which is nearly two orders of magnitude more efficient than traditional GPUs.","[Zou, Chenglong; Cui, Xiaoxin; Kuang, Yisong; Liu, Kefei; Wang, Yuan; Huang, Ru] Peking Univ, Inst Microelect, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zou, Chenglong; Wang, Xinan] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch ECE, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",,"Cui, XX (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Inst Microelect, Beijing, Peoples R China.",cuixx@pku.edu.cn,"Zou, Chenglong/GRY-3327-2022","Zou, Chenglong/0000-0002-2571-3213","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB2202605]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61421005]; 111 Project [B18001]; R&D Project of Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee [JCYJ20200109120404043, KQTD20200820113105004]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); R&D Project of Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee","Funding This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFB2202605), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61421005), the 111 Project (B18001), and R&D Project of Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee (Grant Nos.

Online recognition of milling cutter wear state has been and remains a growing interest in intelligent manufacturing to increase the machining efficiency and control the unqualified rate of workpieces. The effective value of spindle current can effectively characterize the wear state of milling cutter, but it will change along with machining process parameters, which are not suitable for the wear state recognition of milling cutter (WSRMC) under complex working conditions. We present LeNet-WSRMC network, a novel approach to recognize wear state of milling cutter based on the clutter signal of spindle current. The cutting vibration and tool wear are the main reasons for exciting the dynamic cutting force and the clutter signal of spindle current. In order to fully describe the generation mechanism of the clutter signal, we divide the wear state of milling cutter into four categories (i.e., normal wear, severe wear, abnormal vibration caused by tool wear, and abnormal vibration caused by improper selection of cutting parameter when the tool is sharp). LeNet-WSRMC network uses the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model to extract features from the spindle current clutter signal (SCCS) as the wear state of milling cutter classification index. A series of experiments with different cutting parameters and conditions are implemented to validate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed methodology. The experimental results show that this method can realize the online accurate recognition of the wear state of milling cutter under the condition of complex working condition. This study lays a foundation for the prediction of the remaining life of the milling cutter under complex working conditions and the reasonable formulation of the replacement rules of the milling cutter.","[Song, Kaiyu; Wang, Min; Liu, Liming; Wang, Chen; Zan, Tao; Yang, Bin] Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Mech Engn & Appl Elect Technol, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Wang, Min] Beijing Municipal Key Lab Elect Discharge Machini, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",,"Wang, M (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Mech Engn & Appl Elect Technol, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China.;Wang, M (corresponding author), Beijing Municipal Key Lab Elect Discharge Machini, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",kaiyusong@163.com; wangm@bjut.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51575014, 51975020]; Graduate Science and Technology Foundation of Beijing University of Technology [ykj-2018-00501]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Graduate Science and Technology Foundation of Beijing University of Technology,This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51575014 and 51975020) and Graduate Science and Technology Foundation of Beijing University of Technology (Grant No. ykj-2018-00501).,,28,10,10,5,44,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

Hardware accelerators such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are a promising solution that can satisfy these requirements for both embedded and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. In FPGAs, as well as CPUs and GPUs, aggressive voltage scaling below the nominal level is an effective technique for power dissipation minimization Unfortunately, bit-flip faults start to appear as the voltage is scaled down closer to the transistor threshold due to timing issues, thus creating a resilience issue. This paper experimentally evaluates the resilience of the training phase of DNNs in the presence of voltage underscaling related faults of FPGAs, especially in on-chip memories. Toward this goal, we have experimentally evaluated the resilience of LeNet-5 and also a specially designed network for CIFAR-10 dataset with different activation functions of Rectified Linear Unit (Relu) and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh). We have found that modern FPGAs are robust enough in extremely low-voltage levels and that low-voltage related faults can be automatically masked within the training iterations, so there is no need for costly software- or hardware-oriented fault mitigation techniques like ECC. Approximately 10% more training iterations are needed to fill the gap in the accuracy. This observation is the result of the relatively low rate of undervolting faults, i.e., <0.1%, measured on real FPGA fabrics. We have also increased the fault rate significantly for the LeNet-5 network by randomly generated fault injection campaigns and observed that the training accuracy starts to degrade. When the fault rate increases, the network with Tanh activation function outperforms the one with Relu in terms of accuracy, e.g., when the fault rate is 30% the accuracy difference is 4.92%.","[Givaki, Kamyar; Hojabr, Reza; Reza Tayaranian, S.

The continuous development of neural networks with more hidden layers improves the performance but increases the computational complexity. Generally, channel pruning methods are useful to compact neural networks. However, typical channel pruning methods would remove layers by mistake due to the static pruning ratio of manual setting, which could destroy the whole structure of neural networks. It is difficult to improve the ratio of compressing neural networks only by pruning channels while maintaining good network structures. Therefore, we propose a novel neural Networks Pruning by Recurrent Weights (NPRW) that can repeatedly evaluate the significance of weights and adaptively adjust them to compress neural networks within acceptable loss of accuracy. The recurrent weights with low sensitivity are compulsorily set to zero by evaluating the magnitude of weights, and pruned network only uses a few significant weights. Then, we add the regularization to the scaling factors on neural networks, in which recurrent weights with high sensitivity can be dynamically updated and weights of low sensitivity stay at zero invariably. By this way, the significance of channels can be quantitatively evaluated by recurrent weights. It has been verified with typical neural networks of LeNet, VGGNet, and ResNet on multiple benchmark datasets involving stock index futures, digital recognition, and image classification. The pruned LeNet-5 achieves the 58.9% reduction amount of parameters with 0.29% loss of total accuracy for Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 stock index futures. As for the CIFAR-10, the pruned VGG-19 reduces more than 50% FLOPs, and the decrease of network accuracy is less than 0.5%. In addition, the pruned ResNet-164 tested on the SVHN reduces more than 58% FLOPs with relative improvement on accuracy by 0.11%.","[Pei, Songwen] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China; [Pei, Songwen] Chinese Acad Sci, ICT, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yusheng] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jin] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Meikang] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Commerce, TX 75428 USA",,"Pei, SW (corresponding author), Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China.;Pei, SW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, ICT, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",swpei@usst.edu.cn; wysheng6088@163.com; pkugj@pku.edu.cn; meikang.qiu@tamuc.edu,,"Qiu, Meikang/0000-0002-1004-0140","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61975124]; Shanghai Natural Science Foundation [20ZR1438500]; Open Project Program of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science [2020090600003]; State Key Lab of Computer Architecture, ICT, CAS [CARCHA202111]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai); Open Project Program of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science; State Key Lab of Computer Architecture, ICT, CAS","This work was partially funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61975124), the Shanghai Natural Science Foundation (20ZR1438500), the Open Project Program of Shanghai Key Laboratory ofData Science (2020090600003), and the Open Project Funding from the State Key Lab of Computer Architecture, ICT, CAS (CARCHA202111).

The wide and deep DNNs, however, require large amounts of resources (such as memory, storage, and I/O), significantly restricting their utilization on resource-constrained platforms. Although some DNN simplification methods (such as weight quantization) have been proposed to address this issue, they suffer from either low compression ratios or high compression errors, which may introduce an expensive fine-tuning overhead (i.e., a costly retraining process for the target inference accuracy). In this paper, we propose DeepSZ: an accuracy-loss expected neural network compression framework, which involves four key steps: network pruning, error bound assessment, optimization for error bound configuration, and compressed model generation, featuring a high compression ratio and low encoding time. The contribution is threefold. (1) We develop an adaptive approach to select the feasible error bounds for each layer. (2) We build a model to estimate the overall loss of inference accuracy based on the inference accuracy degradation caused by individual decompressed layers. (3) We develop an efficient optimization algorithm to determine the best-fit configuration of error bounds in order to maximize the compression ratio under the user-set inference accuracy constraint. Experiments show that DeepSZ can compress AlexNet and VGG-16 on the ImageNet dataset by a compression ratio of 46x and 116x, respectively, and compress LeNet-300-100 and LeNet-5 on the MNIST dataset by a compression ratio of 57x and 56x, respectively, with only up to 0.3% loss of inference accuracy. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, DeepSZ can improve the compression ratio by up to 1.43x, the DNN encoding performance by up to 4.0x with four V100 GPUs, and the decoding performance by up to 6.2x.","[Jin, Sian; Tian, Jiannan; Tao, Dingwen] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Di, Sheng; Cappello, Franck] Argonne Natl Lab, Lemont, IL USA; [Liang, Xin] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",,"Tao, DW (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Comp Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",sjin6@crimson.ua.edu; sdi1@anl.gov; xlian007@ucr.edu; jtian10@crimson.ua.edu; tao@cs.ua.edu; cappello@mcs.anl.gov,"Tao, Dingwen/U-2888-2019","Tao, Dingwen/0000-0001-5422-4497","Exascale Computing Project (ECP) [17-SC-20-SC]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; National Science Foundation [1619253]; Alabama Water Institute (AWI); Remote Sensing Center (RSC); Center for Complex Hydrosystems Research (CCHR)","Exascale Computing Project (ECP); U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Alabama Water Institute (AWI); Remote Sensing Center (RSC); Center for Complex Hydrosystems Research (CCHR)","This research was supported by the Exascale Computing Project (ECP), Project Number: 17-SC-20-SC, a collaborative effort of two DOE organizations -the Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration, responsible for the planning and preparation of a capable exascale ecosystem, including software, applications, hardware, advanced system engineering and early testbed platforms, to support the nation's exascale computing imperative.

Image-based automated plant diseases identification (APDI) tools have started to been widely used in pest managements strategies. The current APDI systems rely on images captured in laboratory conditions, which hardens the usage of the APDI systems by smallholder farmers. In this study, we investigate whether the smallholder farmers can exploit APDI systems using their basic and cheap unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) with standard cameras. To create the tomato images like the one taken by UAVs, we build a new dataset from a public dataset by using image processing tools. The dataset includes tomato leaf photographs separated into 10 classes (diseases or healthy). To detect the diseases, we develop a new hybrid detection model, called SpikingTomaNet, which merges a novel deep convolutional neural network model with spiking neural network (SNN) model. This hybrid model provides both better accuracy rates for the plant diseases identification and more energy efficiency for the battery-constrained UAVs due to the SNN's event-driven architecture. In this hybrid model, the features extracted from the CNN model are used as the input layer for SNNs. To assess our approach's performance, firstly, we compare the proposed CNN model inside the developed hybrid model with well-known AlexNet, VggNet-5 and LeNet models. Secondly, we compare the developed hybrid model with three hybrid models composed of combinations of the well-known models and SNN model. To train and test the proposed neural network, 32022 images in the dataset are exploited. The results show that the SNN method significantly increases the success, especially in the augmented dataset. The experiment result shows that while the proposed hybrid model provides 97.78% accuracy on original images, its success on the created datasets is between 59.97%-82.98%. In addition, the results shows that the proposed hybrid model provides better overall accuracy in the classification of the diseases in comparison to the well-known models and LeNet and their combination with SNN.","[Demir, Kubilay] Bitlis Eren Univ, Elect Elect Engn Dept, Bitlis, Turkey; [Tumen, Vedat] Bitlis Eren Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Bitlis, Turkey",,"Demir, K (corresponding author), Bitlis Eren Univ, Elect Elect Engn Dept, Bitlis, Turkey.",kdemir@beu.edu.tr; vtumen@beu.edu.tr,"Demir, Kubilay/AAX-3484-2020","Demir, Kubilay/0000-0001-5355-2472; TUMEN, VEDAT/0000-0003-0271-216X",,,,,28,0,0,3,21,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-7126,1875-8452,,AI COMMUN,AI Commun.,,2021.0,34,2,,,,,147,162,,10.3233/AIC-210009,0.0,,,16,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,UQ6UP,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000696198200002,0

We investigate how well deep neural networks identify vocalisations consisting of phrases of varying lengths, each containing a variable number of syllables. We use recordings of Hainan gibbon Nomascus hainanus vocalisations to develop and test the methods. We propose two methods for exploiting the two-level structure of such data. The first combines convolutional neural network (CNN) models with a hidden Markov model (HMM) and the second uses a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). Both models learn acoustic features of syllables via a CNN and temporal correlations of syllables into phrases either via an HMM or recurrent network. We compare their performance to commonly used CNNs LeNet and VGGNet, and support vector machine (SVM). We also propose a dynamic programming method to evaluate how well phrases are predicted. This is useful for evaluating performance when vocalisations are labelled by phrases, not syllables. Our methods perform substantially better than the commonly used methods when applied to the gibbon acoustic recordings. The CRNN has an F-score of 90% on phrase prediction, which is 18% higher than the best of the SVM or LeNet and VGGNet methods. HMM post-processing raised the F-score of these last three methods to as much as 87%. The number of phrases is overestimated by CNNs and SVM, leading to error rates between 49% and 54%. With HMM, these error rates can be reduced to 0.4% at the lowest. Similarly, the error rate of CRNN's prediction is no more than 0.5%. CRNNs are better at identifying phrases of varying lengths composed of a varying number of syllables than simpler CNN or SVM models. We find a CRNN model to be best at this task, with a CNN combined with an HMM performing almost as well. We recommend that these kinds of models are used for species whose vocalisations are structured into phrases of varying lengths.","[Wang, Yuheng; Borchers, David L.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Math & Stat, Ctr Res Ecol & Environm Modelling, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Ye, Juan] Univ St Andrews, Sch Comp Sci, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Borchers, David L.] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat, Cape Town, South Africa",,"Wang, YH (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Math & Stat, Ctr Res Ecol & Environm Modelling, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",yw99@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Ye, Juan/0000-0002-2838-6836; Borchers, David/0000-0002-3944-0754",China Scholarship Council [202008060348],China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"China Scholarship Council, Grant/Award Number: 202008060348",,64,0,0,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,2041-2096,,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

We inject current into the crossbar through randomly set ReRAM cells to add the adaptive regularization, and no retraining and data extraction is needed in our proposal.

Due to the physical generation of merged matrix and in-memory error computing as well as proposed conductance drift (CD) compensation protocols, the training time and energy consumptions of VGG-16 are reduced by 3x and 3.3x, respectively, compared with hardware-accelerated in-memory BP training, with 90% accuracy on CIFAR-10.","[Lu, Yingming; Yan, Longhao; Zhang, Teng; Yang, Yuchao; Huang, Ru] Peking Univ, Dept Micro Nanoelect, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Xi; Song, Zhitang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Microsyst & Informat Technol, State Key Lab Funct Mat Informat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yuchao; Huang, Ru] Peking Univ, Ctr Brain Inspired Chips, Inst Artificial Intelligence, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Yang, YC; Huang, R (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Dept Micro Nanoelect, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Song, ZT (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Microsyst & Informat Technol, State Key Lab Funct Mat Informat, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Yang, YC; Huang, R (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Ctr Brain Inspired Chips, Inst Artificial Intelligence, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yuchaoyan@pku.edu.cn; ztsong@mail.sim.ac.cn; ruhuang@pku.edu.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0207600]; NSFC [61925401, 61674006, 61927901, 61421005]; 111 Project [B18001]; PKU-Baidu Fund [2019BD002]; Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation [2019BD002]; Tencent Foundation through the Xplorer Prize [2019BD002]","National Key R&D Program of China; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); PKU-Baidu Fund; Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation(Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation); Tencent Foundation through the Xplorer Prize","This work is supported by National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFA0207600), NSFC (61925401, 61674006, 61927901, 61421005), 111 Project (B18001), Project 2019BD002 by PKU-Baidu Fund, Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation, and Tencent Foundation through the Xplorer Prize.",,7,6,6,3,9,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2380-9248,,978-1-7281-8888-1,INT EL DEVICES MEET,,,2020.0,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/IEDM13553.2020.9371910,0.0,,,4,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BS3ZJ,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000717011600022,0

Then an improved histogram equalization is used to enhance each cropped image. Furthermore, the Inception-V1 model is employed to predict the existence of defects in the local area. Finally, we apply the LeNet-5 model, which plays the role of a voting model, to recognize the type of the defect in the fabric.

In this paper, we successfully introduce the use of computer vision technology to predict the cleanliness of rusty iron in laser cleaning. Statistical approaches, i.e., machine learning methods, can be used to construct a model of the process directly from images of the laser cleaning samples, which may avoid understanding the physical principle of laser cleaning. To apply a convolutional neural network (CNN), we not only build a laser cleaning dataset, but also propose an effective cleanliness evaluation index. We introduce the details of them on the rusty irons, for example. Then, we use the CNN to model laser cleaning successfully. A LeNet-5 network achieves a final accuracy of 82.45% while predicting the cleanliness, which shows the potential of this approach for modeling a nonlinear process from experimental data. Thus, for a given pre-cleaned image and laser parameters, laser cleaning cleanliness can be predicted.","[Sun, Bo; Xu, Chang; He, Jun; Yu, Lejun; Zhang, Yinghui] Beijing Normal Univ, Engn Res Ctr Intelligent Technol & Educ Applicat, Minist Educ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yinghui] Hebei Finance Univ, Smart Financial Res & Dev Ctr, 3188 North Hengxiang St, Baoding 071051, Peoples R China",,"He, J (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Engn Res Ctr Intelligent Technol & Educ Applicat, Minist Educ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",hejun@bnu.edu.cn,,,National Key Research And Development Program [2017YFB0405101],National Key Research And Development Program,National Key Research And Development Program (Grant No. 2017YFB0405101).,,24,4,5,5,33,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0947-8396,1432-0630,,APPL PHYS A-MATER,Appl.

The DropIn layer starts by passing the output from a previous layer ( effectively skipping over the newly added layers), then increasingly including units from the new layers for both feedforward and backpropagation. We show that deep networks, which are untrainable with conventional methods, will converge with DropIn layers interspersed in the architecture. In addition, we demonstrate that DropIn provides regularization during training in an analogous way as dropout.

In the proposed control scheme, the trained CNN directly generates the velocity command of the manipulator so that the pressure distribution converges to a given desired pressure distribution.

Most CNN architectures rely on pooling layers to reduce the resolution along spatial dimensions. The reduction allows subsequent deep convolution layers to operate with greater efficiency. This paper introduces adaptive wavelet pooling layers, which employ fast wavelet transforms (FWT) to reduce the feature resolution. The FWT decomposes the input features into multiple scales reducing the feature dimensions by removing the fine-scale subbands. Our approach adds extra flexibility through wavelet-basis function optimization and coefficient weighting at different scales. The adaptive wavelet layers integrate directly into well-known CNNs like the LeNet, Alexnet, or Densenet architectures.

The proposed methodology contains two main steps. In suspicious fire region proposal, we introduce a novel superpixel algorithm (SCMM) driven by Cauchy mixture model. Then, the negative Under-segmentation Error (UE) of each superpixel is applied to inter-frame comparison for predicting varying superpixels. After that, by computing the features of motion superpixels using Local Difference Binary (LDB) descriptor for two adjacent frames, the suspicious fire regions are localized. In following fire identification, to improve network performance while reducing computational complexity, this study presents a light-weight network architecture, called Expanded Squeeze-and-Excitation ShuffleNet (ESE-ShuffleNet). All suspicious fire regions are sent into this network to identify as either fire or non-fire included. Experiments show that our framework performs well on fire detection tasks.

Then by deleting the nodes whose importance is below the optimal threshold, the purpose of pruning the network is achieved.

The analysis of gridded climate data to find spatial patterns of meteorological variables that produce tornadoes is often a time consuming and manual process requiring visual inspection. Therefore, the ability to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize patterns in climate data that produce tornado outbreaks would be a huge benefit to climatologists. In this paper, three CNNs of increasing complexity, including LeNet-5, VGG-16, and Resnet-50 were trained to predict days with tornado outbreaks of varying size based on gridded values of convective available potential energy (CAPE), convective inhibition (CIN), storm relative helicity (HLCY), and geopotential height. All three models showed promising results in predicting large tornado outbreaks with greater than 20 tornadoes with VGG-16 using the variable CAPE having a slightly better performance, highlighting the importance of CAPE in the analysis of tornado environments.","[McGuire, Michael P.] Towson Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA; [Moore, Todd W.] Ft Hays State Univ, Dept Geosci, 600 Pk St, Hays, KS 67601 USA",,"McGuire, MP (corresponding author), Towson Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",mmcguire@towson.edu; twmoore@fhsu.edu,,,,,,,35,0,0,3,3,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0098-3004,1873-7803,,COMPUT GEOSCI-UK,Comput.

To be specific, the whole word image is regarded as input of CNN. Hence, the word images should be normalized into the same size before being inputted into CNN. By comparison, an appropriate aspect ratio for the traditional Mongolian word images has been determined. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CNN architecture outperforms three classic CNN architectures, including LeNet-5, AlexNet and GoogLeNet.

As a result, the inherent random fluctuation error and long latency of processing random bitstreams have made previous SC-CNN implementations inefficient compared with conventional binary designs. To address these issues, in this brief, an efficient convolution architecture based on fast FIR algorithm (FFA) is proposed by employing FFA to reduce the computational complexity. Further, the combination of two-line SC and Sobol sequences is applied to decrease the processing cycles.

In this paper, we propose a CAD system based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically count mitotic cells. The proposed system consists of three steps. First, a normalization process is exploited to reduce the illumination variance and noise among different individuals as well as highlight the nuclei regions, which can simplify the problem of mitotic counting. Second, an improved convolutional neural network based on LeNet-5 is established to extract features. Last, Softmax can finally determine the location of mitotic cells.

After the CNN training process, the converged filter weights define a set of anchor vectors in the RECOS model. Anchor vectors represent the frequently occurring patterns (or the spectral components). The necessity of rectification is explained using the RECOS model.

In this work, we consider faults on different data types and develop a simulation framework for understanding the fault resiliency of compressed DNN models as compared to uncompressed models. We perform our experiments on two common DNNs, LeNet-5 and VGG16, and evaluate their fault resiliency with different types of compression.

To address these drawbacks and satisfy the demands of embedded hardware, this paper proposes a computationally efficient magnitude-based pruning scheme, based on a half-interval search, combined with effective weight sharing, fixed-point quantization, and lossless compression. The proposed solution can be utilized to generate an optimized model, either with respect to memory demand or execution time. For instance, the memory demand of LeNet is compressed about 385x. VGG16 is pruned by about 14.5x, whilst its computational costs are reduced by about 1.6x for a CPU-based application and 4.8x for an FPGA one.","[Frickenstein, Alexander; Unger, Christian] BMW Grp, Autonomous Driving, Munich, Germany; [Stechele, Walter] Tech Univ Munich, Elect & Comp Engn, Munich, Germany",,"Frickenstein, A (corresponding author), BMW Grp, Autonomous Driving, Munich, Germany.",alexander.frickenstein@bmw.de; christian.unger@bmw.de; walter.stechele@tum.de,"Frickenstein, Alexander/AAF-1090-2020",,,,,,40,0,0,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-1838-3,,,,2019.0,,,,,,,17,24,,10.1109/CRV.2019.00011,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Robotics,BO1TX,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000502543900003,0

Without any accuracy loss, our method can efficiently compress the number of parameters in LeNet-5 and AlexNet by a factor of 108x and 17:7x respectively, proving that it outperforms the recent pruning method by considerable margins.

In this paper, we propose the hyperbolic linear units (HLUs) which not only speed up learning process in deep convolutional neural networks but also obtain better performance in image classification tasks. Unlike ReLUs, HLUs have inheriently negative values which could make mean unit outputs closer to zero. Mean unit outputs close to zero means we can speed up the learning process because they bring the normal gradient close to the natural gradient. Indeed, the difference called bias shift between natural gradient and the normal gradient is related to the mean activation of input units. Experiments with three popular CNN architectures, LeNet, Inception network and ResNet on various benchmarks including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our proposed HLUs achieve significant improvement compared to other commonly used activation functions.","[Li, Jia; Xu, Hua; Deng, Junhui; Sun, Xiaomin] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Intelligent Technol & Syst, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",,"Xu, H (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Intelligent Technol & Syst, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",callmecoding@sina.com; xuhua@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2012CB316301],National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China),This work is supported by National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (Grant No: 2012CB316301).,,25,5,5,0,7,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2161-4393,,978-1-5090-0619-9,IEEE IJCNN,,,2016.0,,,,,,,353,359,,,,,,7,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BH3QM,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000399925500048,0

The dataset used in this work was generated by finite element simulation of a simple cylinder with different defect depths. The simulation was carried out with the commercial software On-scale (TM). In this way, 100 samples were obtained representing diverse structural conditions. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture based on LeNet-5 was proposed to address the problem.

In addition, many fine-grained pruning methods focus the pruning on the fully connected layer rather than the convolution layer. The group pruning technique is proposed, focusing only on CONV-layer that enables to keep the weight reduction rate consistent within each weight group. This helps solve some inefficiency problems including internal buffer misalignment and load imbalance after fine-grained pruning. In the pre-training, the strategy of group sparse regularization (GSR) and standardizing the weight distribution is added to alleviate the loss of precision under high sparsity. Finally, we used the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets to test the LeNet and VGG-16 for experiments.

Structured pruning is a promising method to compress and accelerate CNNs and does not need special hardware or software for an auxiliary calculation. Here a simple strategy of structured pruning approach is proposed to crop unimportant filters or neurons automatically during the training stage. The proposed method introduces a mask for all filters or neurons to evaluate their importance. Thus the filters or neurons with zero mask are removed. To achieve this, the proposed method adopted L1 regularization to zero filters or neurons of CNNs. Experiments were conducted to assess the validity of this technique. The experiments showed that the proposed approach could crop 90.4%, 95.6% and 34.04% parameters on LeNet-5, VGG-16, and ResNet-32respectively, with a negligible loss of accuracy.","[Yang, Chen; Yang, Zhenghong; Yang, Liu; Zhang, Wenxin; Gao, Wanlin; Wang, Minjuan] Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Key Lab Agr Informatizat Standardizat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Yang, Chen; Yang, Zhenghong; Khattak, Abdul Mateen; Yang, Liu; Zhang, Wenxin; Gao, Wanlin; Wang, Minjuan] China Agr Univ, Coll Informat & Elect Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Khattak, Abdul Mateen] Univ Agr, Dept Hort, Peshawar 25120, Pakistan",,"Gao, WL; Wang, MJ (corresponding author), Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Key Lab Agr Informatizat Standardizat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;Gao, WL; Wang, MJ (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Informat & Elect Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",wanlin_cau@163.com; minjuan@cau.edu.cn,,"Yang, Shuangming/0000-0002-8044-0860; Gao, Wanlin/0000-0002-4845-4541; Wang, Minjuan/0000-0002-7520-1726",Project of Scientific Operating Expenses from Ministry of Education of China [2017PT19],Project of Scientific Operating Expenses from Ministry of Education of China,This work was supported by the Project of Scientific Operating Expenses from Ministry of Education of China under Grant 2017PT19.,,43,9,9,0,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019.0,7,,,,,,106385,106394,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2933032,0.0,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,IS2GX,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000481972100086,0

In this paper we propose a spectrum sensing algorithm for orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) signal based on deep learning and covariance matrix graph. The advantage of deep learning in image processing is applied to the spectrum sensing of OFDM signals. We start by building the spectrum sensing model of OFDM signal, and then analyze structural characteristics of covariance matrix (CM). Once CM has been normalized and transformed into a gray level representation, the gray scale map of covariance matrix (GSM-CM) is established. Then, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed based on the LeNet-5 network, which is used to learn the training data to obtain more abstract features hierarchically. Finally, the test data is input into the trained spectrum sensing network model, based on which spectrum sensing of OFDM signals is completed. Simulation results show that this method can complete the spectrum sensing task by taking advantage of the GSM-CM model, which has better spectrum sensing performance for OFDM signals under low SNR than existing methods.","[Zhang, Mengbo; Wang, Lunwen; Feng, Yanqing; Yin, Haibo] Natl Univ Def Technol, Elect Countermeasure Inst, Hefei 230037, Anhui, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, MB (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Elect Countermeasure Inst, Hefei 230037, Anhui, Peoples R China.",zhangmengbo26@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61273302, 61671454]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (grant nos. 61273302, 61671454).",,20,3,3,3,33,IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS ENG,TOKYO,"KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG, 3-5-8, SHIBA-KOEN, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-0011, JAPAN",0916-8516,1745-1345,,IEICE T COMMUN,IEICE Trans.

The paper uses the concept of adversarial samples in image recognition for reference to the field of network traffic classification and chooses several different methods to generate adversarial samples of network traffic.

We present MONARCH, a framework-agnostic middleware for hierarchical storage management. This solution leverages the existing storage tiers present at modern supercomputers (e.g., compute node's local storage, PFS) to improve DL training performance and alleviate the current I/O pressure of the shared PFS. We validate the applicability of our approach by developing and integrating an early prototype with the TensorFlow DL framework. Results show that MONARCH can reduce I/O operations submitted to the shared PFS by up to 45%, decreasing training time by 24% and 12%, for I/O-intensive models, namely LeNet and AlexNet.","[Dantas, Marco; Leitao, Diogo; Correia, Claudia; Macedo, Ricardo; Paulo, Joao] INESC TEC, Porto, Portugal; [Dantas, Marco; Leitao, Diogo; Correia, Claudia; Macedo, Ricardo; Paulo, Joao] Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal; [Xu, Weijia] Texas Adv Comp Ctr, Austin, TX USA",,"Dantas, M (corresponding author), INESC TEC, Porto, Portugal.;Dantas, M (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal.",,"Paulo, João/GLU-7859-2022","Paulo, João/0000-0001-9752-2822; Macedo, Ricardo/0000-0003-4036-0126","FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [UTAEXPL/CA/0075/2019, SFRH/BD/146059/2019]; NSF at Texas Advanced Computing Center [1818253]",FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); NSF at Texas Advanced Computing Center,Work financed by National Funds through the FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia within project UTAEXPL/CA/0075/2019 and PhD grant SFRH/BD/146059/2019 (Ricardo Macedo).

By using time-domain signal processing, the huge convolution operations of BNN can be effectively replaced to the CAM search operation. In addition, thanks to fully parallel search of CAM, the parallel convolution operations for non-overlapped filtering window is enabled for high throughput data processing. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed CAM based BNN accelerator, the convolutional layer of LeNet-5 model has been implemented using 65nm CMOS technology. The implementation results show that the proposed BNN accelerator achieves 9.4% and 38.5% of area and energy savings, respectively.

Some vibration-based machine learning methods have been developed for recognizing pump cavitation. However, their fault diagnostic performance is often unsatisfactory in industrial applications due to the sensitivity of the vibration signal to noise. In this paper, we present an intelligent method for recognizing the cavitation severity of an axial piston pump in a noisy environment. First, we adopt short-time Fourier transformation to convert the raw vibration data into spectrograms that act as input images of a modified LeNet-5 convolutional neural network (CNN). Second, we propose a denoising method for the converted spectrograms based on frequency spectrum characteristics. Finally, we verify the proposed method on the dataset from a test rig of a high-speed axial piston pump. The experimental results indicate that the denoising method significantly improves the diagnostic performance of the CNN model in a noisy environment. For example, using the denoising method, the accuracy rate forcavitation recognition increases from 0.52 to 0.92 at a signal-to-noise ratio of 4 dB.","[Lei, Junbo] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mech Syst & Vibrat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, AI Inst, MoE Key Lab Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",,"Lei, JB (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Mech Syst & Vibrat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",jblei@sjtu.edu.cn,,"xiaoliang, wei/0000-0001-7768-8921",National Key R&D Program of China [2020YFB1709604]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [52005323]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M660086]; China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents [BX20200210]; Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project [2021SHZDZX0102],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents; Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project,"This work was financially supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2020YFB1709604), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 52005323), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2019M660086), the China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents (No. BX20200210), and the Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project (No. 2021SHZDZX0102).",,35,5,5,16,25,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0957-0233,1361-6501,,MEAS SCI TECHNOL,Meas.

More specifically, the two-dimensional dataset of the received signal is established under the various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions firstly. Then, an improved deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) is proposed to expand the training set so as to address the issue of data shortage.

To address these limitations, especially in resource-constrained devices, the use of cloud computing for CNNs is becoming more popular. This comes with privacy and latency concerns that have motivated the designers to develop embedded hardware accelerators for CNNs. However, designing a specialized accelerator increases the time-to-market and cost of production. Therefore, to reduce the time-to-market and access to state-of-the-art techniques, CNN hardware mapping and deployment on embedded accelerators are often outsourced to untrusted third parties, which is going to be more prevalent in futuristic artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) systems. These AIoT systems anticipates horizontal collaboration among different resource constrained AIoT node devices, where CNN layers are partitioned and these devices collaboratively compute complex CNN tasks. This horizontal collaboration opens another attack surface to the CNN-based application, like inserting the hardware Trojans (HT) into the embedded accelerators designed for the CNN. Therefore, there is a dire need to explore this attack surface for designing the secure embedded hardware accelerators for CNNs. Towards this goal, in this paper, we exploited this attack surface to propose an HT-based attack called FeSHI. Since in horizontal collaboration of RC AIoT devices different sections of CNN architectures are outsourced to different untrusted third parties, the attacker may not know the input image, but it has access to the layer-by-layer output feature maps information for the assigned sections of the CNN architecture. This attack exploits the statistical distribution, i.e., Gaussian distribution, of the layer-by-layer feature maps of the CNN to design two triggers for stealthy HT with a very low probability of triggering. Also three different novel, stealthy and effective trigger designs are proposed. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack, we deployed the LeNet and LeNet-3D on PYNQ to classify the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, and tested FeSHI. The experimental results show that FeSHI utilizes up to 2% extra LUTs, and the overall resource overhead is less than 1% compared to the original designs. It is also demonstrated on the PYNQ board that FeSHI triggers the attack vary randomly making it extremely difficult to detect.","[Odetola, Tolulope A.; Mohammed, Hawzhin; Sandefur, Travis C.; Hasan, Syed Rafay] Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA; [Khalid, Faiq] Tech Univ Wien TU Wien, Dept Comp Engn, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",,"Hasan, SR (corresponding author), Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA.",shasan@tntech.edu,,,"Carnegie Classication Funding through the College of Engineering; Faculty Research Grant through the Ofce of Research, Tennessee Tech University","Carnegie Classication Funding through the College of Engineering; Faculty Research Grant through the Ofce of Research, Tennessee Tech University","This work was supported in part by the Carnegie Classication Funding through the College of Engineering, and in part by the Faculty Research Grant through the Ofce of Research, Tennessee Tech University.",,42,0,0,0,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021.0,9,,,,,,115370,115387,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104520,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,UE9TX,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000688226400001,0

In this work, we pro-vide an approach to include metaplasticity in convolutional neural networks to enhance learning in image classification problems. This approach consists of including metaplasticity as a weight update function in the backpropagation stage of convolutional layers. To validate this proposal, we have been used eight different award-winning convolutional neural networks architectures: LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG16, VGG32, ResNet50, DenseNet121 and DenseNet169; trained with four different pop-ular datasets for benchmarking: MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Experimental results show that there is a performance enhancement for each of the convolution neural network architectures in all the datasets used.

However, researchers have recently discovered that deep learning models have security risks and are easily affected by adversarial examples. The adversarial example is a sample formed by deliberately adding subtle perturbation that is invisible to the human in the dataset. It can make the classification classify incorrectly with a high degree of confidence, which poses more challenges for deep learning research. In this paper, we propose a defense model based on the supervision mechanism. The model adds supervision layers to the original convolutional neural network and improves the robustness and defense ability of the model by improving the loss function. The LeNet-5 and VGG networks are used as the original network models.

As the target data to this issue are huge and consequently, a handling approach might potentially be a very time consuming one, one of the major challenges to be solved by this introduced approach is its ability for dealing with large-scale datasets. A deep neural network might be a good option to resolve this challenge. It can provide a good accuracy while dealing with huge databases. In the proposed approach, the new architecture is introduced using a combination of AlexNet and LeNet architectures. It uses convolutional, polling and fully-connected layers. The results are tested on two large-scale datasets. These tests show that the introduced architecture is more accurate than the other recently developed methods in identifying unconventional images. The proposed approach may be used in different applications such as intelligent filtering of unconventional images or medical images analysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this issue, compressing the CNN model is an efficient solution. This work presents a new framework of model compression, with the sparseness ratio allocation (SRA) and the neuron re-pruning (NRP). To achieve a higher overall spareness ratio, SRA is exploited to determine pruned weight percentage for each layer. NRP is performed after the usual weight pruning to further reduce the relative redundant neurons in the meanwhile of guaranteeing the accuracy. From experimental results, with a slight accuracy drop of 0.1%, the proposed framework achieves 149.3 x compression on lenet-5.

We will analyze these images by varying values so as to obtain output layer of our network 10 neurons, each neuron if fixed gives any output between 0 to 9. After reading in data appropriately from MNIST and testing it on Gaussian distribution, KNN classifier then presented the result with Python tool. So, to avoid such a long waiting another algorithm Convolutional Neural Networks has been used. CNN has been implemented on Keras including Tensorflow and produces accuracy. It is then shown that KNN and CNN perform competitively with their respective algorithm on this dataset, while CNN produces high accuracy than KNN and hence chosen as a better approach.","[Makkar, Tanya] Amity Univ Uttar Pradesh, Amity Sch Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Noida, India; [Kumar, Yogesh; Dubey, Ashwani Kr] Amity Univ Uttar Pradesh, Amity Sch Engn & Technol, Dept ECE, Noida, India; [Rocha, Alvaro] Univ Coimbra, Dept Informat Engn, Coimbra, Portugal; [Goyal, Ayush] Texas A&M Univ, Elect & Commun Engn, Kingsville, TX USA",,"Makkar, T (corresponding author), Amity Univ Uttar Pradesh, Amity Sch Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Noida, India.",munishmakkar65@yahoo.com; eceyogesh@gmail.com; dubeylak@gmail.com; amrocha@dei.uc.pt; ayush.goyal@tamuk.edu,"Rocha, Álvaro/O-3273-2013; Goyal, Ayush/W-8421-2019; , Dr Yogesh/AAI-1831-2021","Rocha, Álvaro/0000-0002-0750-8187; , Dr Yogesh/0000-0002-0746-0558",,,,,20,9,9,0,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-6734-3,,,,2017.0,,,,,,,182,187,,,,,,6,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BJ8KD,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000428329100035,0

The architecture proposed can solve the difficult implementation challenges that SC presents for CNN applications, such as the high resources used in binary-to-stochastic conversion, the inaccuracy produced by an undesired correlation between signals, and the stochastic maximum function implementation. Compared with traditional binary logic implementations, experimental results showed an improvement of 19.6x and 63x in terms of speed performance and energy efficiency for the FPGA implementation.

The empirical design and optimisation of a new CNN architecture require a lot of expertise and can be very time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm that can, for a given image processing task, efficiently explore a defined space of potentially suitable CNN architectures and simultaneously optimise their hyperparameters. We named this fast automatic optimisation model fast-CNN and employed it to find competitive CNN architectures for image classification on CIFAR10. In a series of comparative simulation experiments we could demonstrate that the network designed by fast-CNN achieved nearly as good accuracy as some of the other best network models available but fast-CNN took significantly less time to evolve.

In this paper, we design an effective method aiming at improving the efficiency in evolutionary pruning, called IEEPruner. Multiple pruning criteria are first utilized to initialize an efficient search space, and then a novel encoding scheme is proposed to further reduce the search space. After that, we formulate the search of the optimal pruned structure as a multiobjective optimization problem, and integrate a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to achieve a good balance between model size and accuracy in an automatic manner. Thus, we automatically search for the optimal pruned model in this search space.

When transplanting DNN models to such platforms, requirements pertaining to computation and memory use are bottlenecks. To overcome them, network pruning has been carefully studied as a method of network compression. The effectiveness of network pruning is significantly affected by incorrect pruning on important connections. In this paper, we propose a network pruning method based on the modified L-1/2 penalty that reduces incorrect pruning by increasing the sparsity of the pretrained models. The modified L-1/2 penalty yields better sparsity than the L-1 penalty at a similar computational cost. Compared with the past work that numerically defines the importance of connections and re-establishes important weights when incorrect pruning occurs, our method achieves faster convergence by using a simpler pruning strategy.

However, the optimization of the hyper-parameters in fusing different sparseness strategies demands much computation, when the traditional gradient-based algorithms are used. In this work, an iterative framework with surrogate network is proposed for the optimization of hyper-parameters in fusing different sparseness strategies. In each iteration, a network with significantly smaller model complexity is fitted to the original large network based on four Euclidean losses, where the hyper-parameters are optimized with heuristic optimizers. Since the surrogate network uses the same deep metrics and embeds the same hyper-parameters as the original network, the optimized hyper-parameters are then used for the training of the original deep network in the next iteration. While the performance of the proposed algorithm is justified with a tiny model, i.e. LeNet on the FER2013 database, our approach achieved competitive performances on six publicly available expression datasets, i.e., FER2013, CK+, Oulu-CASIA, MMI, AFEW and AffectNet.

Therefore, hardware operators able to reconfigure their computational precision at runtime are increasingly employed in these devices, to obtain good-enough results at minimal energy costs. Among the many methods proposed to implement such operators, Dynamic Voltage and Accuracy Scaling (DVAS) is particularly promising, due to its broad applicability and low overheads. However, a straight-forward application of DVAS conflicts with the optimizations performed by classic EDA algorithms, and does not yield the expected results. In this paper, we propose a novel synthesis algorithm for reconfigurable-precision circuits, that allows to integrate DVAS in a standard implementation flow. Moreover, we show how this algorithm can exploit information about the application, namely on the frequency of usage of each precision, to further reduce the total energy consumption. Applying our method to the popular LeNet neural network for digit recognition, we are able to reduce the energy due to Multiply-And-Accumulate (MAC) operations by 25%, compared to a straight-forward application of DVAS.","[Pagliari, Daniele Jahier; Poncino, Massimo] Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Automat & Informat, Turin, Italy",,"Pagliari, DJ (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Automat & Informat, Turin, Italy.",daniele.jahier@polito.it; massimo.poncino@polito.it,"Pagliari, Daniele Jahier/AAU-8670-2021; PAGLIARI, DANIELE JAHIER/Z-5988-2019","PAGLIARI, DANIELE JAHIER/0000-0002-2872-7071",,,,,16,12,12,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0271-4302,,978-1-5386-4881-0,IEEE INT SYMP CIRC S,,,2018.0,,,,,,,,,,10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351232,0.0,,,5,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BL5BO,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000451218701135,0

However, the nonlinear weight updating property of memristors makes it difficult to be trained in a neural network learning process. Several compensation schemes have been proposed to mitigate the updating error caused by nonlinearity; nevertheless, they usually involve complex peripheral circuits design. Herein, stochastic and adaptive learning methods for weight updating are developed, in which the inaccuracy caused by the memristor nonlinearity can be effectively suppressed. In addition, compared with the traditional nonlinear stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updating algorithm or the piecewise linear (PL) method, which are most often used in memristor neural network, the design is more hardware friendly and energy efficient without the consideration of pulse numbers, duration, and directions. Effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated on the training of LeNet-5 convolutional neural network.

Together with the use of a particular form of prior, the estimation of the hyperparameter reduces to an automatic relevance determination model, which provides a soft way of pruning model parameters. Despite the effectiveness of this estimation procedure, it has stayed primarily as a heuristic to date and its application to deep neural network has not yet been explored. This paper formally investigates the mathematical nature of this procedure and justifies it as a well-principled algorithm framework, which we call the MacKay algorithm. As an application, we demonstrate its use in deep neural networks, which have typically complicated structure with millions of parameters and can be pruned to reduce the memory requirement and boost computational efficiency. In experiments, we adopt MacKay algorithm to prune the parameters of both simple networks such as LeNet, deep convolution VGG-like networks, and residual netowrks for large image classification task.

However, when a pretrained deep neural network (DNN) model is programmed to an RRAM array for inference, the model suffers from accuracy degradation due to RRAM nonidealities, such as device variations, quantization error, and stuck-at-faults. Previous solutions involving multiple read- verify-write (R-V-W) to the RRAM cells require cell-by-cell compensation and, thus, an excessive amount of processing time. In this article, we propose a joint algorithm-design solution to mitigate the accuracy degradation. We first leverage knowledge distillation (KD), where the model is trained with the RRAM nonidealities to increase the robustness of the model under device variations. Furthermore, we propose random sparse adaptation (RSA), which integrates a small on-chip memory with the main RRAM array for postmapping adaptation. Only the on-chip memory is updated to recover the inference accuracy. The joint algorithm-design solution achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.41% for MNIST (LeNet-5) and 91.86% for CIFAR-10 (VGG-16) with up to 5% parameters as overhead while providing a 15-150x speedup compared with R-V-W.","[Charan, Gouranga; Mohanty, Abinash; Du, Xiaocong; Krishnan, Gokul; Cao, Yu] Arizona State Univ, Sch Elect Comp & Energy Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Joshi, Rajiv V.] IBM Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA",,"Charan, G; Cao, Y (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Elect Comp & Energy Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",gcharang@asu.edu; ycao@asu.edu,"Charan, Gouranga/AAH-9501-2021","Charan, Gouranga/0000-0002-1335-0670; Cao, Yu/0000-0001-6968-1180","Center for Brain-Inspired Computing (C-BRIC), one of six centers in JUMP; Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) program - DARPA; National Science Foundation (CCF) [1715443]","Center for Brain-Inspired Computing (C-BRIC), one of six centers in JUMP; Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) program - DARPA; National Science Foundation (CCF)(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was supported in part by the Center for Brain-Inspired Computing (C-BRIC), one of six centers in JUMP, in part by the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) program sponsored by DARPA, and in part by the National Science Foundation (CCF #1715443).",,30,9,9,2,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-9231,,,IEEE J EXPLOR SOLID-,IEEE J.

This is an old problem of renewed interest because of the need to compress ever larger nets so they can run in mobile devices. Pruning has been traditionally done by ranking or penalizing weights according to some criterion (such as magnitude), removing low-ranked weights and retraining the remaining ones. We formulate pruning as an optimization problem offinding the weights that minimize the loss while satisfying a pruning cost condition. We give a generic algorithm to solve this which alternates learning steps that optimize a regularized, data-dependent loss and compression steps that mark weights Jr pruning in a data-independent way. Magnitude thresholding, arises naturally in the compression step, but unlike existing magnitude pruning approaches, our algorithm explores subsets of weights rather than committing irrevocably to a specific subset from the beginning. It is also able to learn automatically the best number of weights to prune in each layer of the net without incurring an exponentially costly model selection. Using a single pruning level user parameter, we achieve state-of-th,e-art pruning in LeNet and ResNets of various sizes.","[Carreira-Perpinan, Miguel A.; Idelbayev, Yerlan] Univ Calif, EECS, Merced, CA 95343 USA",,"Carreira-Perpinan, MA (corresponding author), Univ Calif, EECS, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",,,,"NSF [IIS-1423515, ACI-1429783]; UC Merced Faculty Research Grant",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UC Merced Faculty Research Grant,"Work supported by NSF award IIS-1423515, by a UC Merced Faculty Research Grant, by a Titan X Pascal GPU donated by the NVIDIA Corporation, and by computing time in the MERCED cluster (NSF grant ACI-1429783).",,33,76,80,4,7,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1063-6919,,978-1-5386-6420-9,PROC CVPR IEEE,,,2018.0,,,,,,,8532,8541,,10.1109/CVPR.2018.00890,0.0,,,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BL9NZ,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000457843608073,0

There are a large number of implementation options with very different approximation strategies (such as pruning, quantization, low-rank factorization, knowledge distillation, etc.). To the best of our knowledge, no automated approach exists to explore, select and generate the best approximate versions of a given convolutional neural network (CNN) according to the design objectives.

However, many gradient-based optimization methods contain more sensitive hyper-parameters which require endless ways of configuring. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive mechanism called adaptive exponential decay rate (AEDR). AEDR uses an adaptive exponential decay rate rather than a fixed and preconfigured one, and it can allow us to eliminate one otherwise tuning sensitive hyper-parameters. AEDR also can be used to calculate exponential decay rate adaptively by employing the moving average of both gradients and squared gradients over time.

For such implementations, the multiply-accumulate operation is the main reason for resultant high resource and energy requirements. To address these challenges, we present Rox-ANN, a design methodology for implementing ANNs using processing elements (PEs) designed with low-precision fixed-point numbers and high performance and reduced-area approximate multipliers on FPGAs. The trained design parameters of the ANN are analyzed and clustered to optimize the total number of approximate multipliers required in the design. With our methodology, we achieve insignificant loss in application accuracy. We evaluated the design using a LeNet based implementation of the MNIST digit recognition application. The results show a 65.6%, 55.1% and 18.9% reduction in area, energy consumption and latency for a PE using 8-bit precision weights and activations and approximate arithmetic units, when compared to 16-bit full precision, accurate arithmetic PEs.","[Balaji, Adarsha; Das, Anup] Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Ullah, Salim; Kumar, Akash] Tech Univ Dresden, Dresden, Germany",,"Balaji, A (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,"Das, Anup/AAZ-4792-2021; Balaji, Adarsha/AED-0208-2022; Kumar, Akash/ABB-4676-2020","Das, Anup/0000-0002-5673-2636; ",,,,,18,2,2,0,4,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",1066-1395,,978-1-4503-6252-8,PR GR LAK SYMP VLSI,,,2019.0,,,,,,,489,494,,10.1145/3299874.3319490,0.0,,,6,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BN1GF,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000474339800097,0

In this paper, SS is considered to be a binary classification problem, in which Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks(DCGAN) is improved and used to expand the training set to cope with the shortage of sample data. More specifically, the sampling covariance matrix of the received signal is firstly transformed into the true color picture which is divided into a training set and a test set. After that, the obtained training set is expanded with the improved DCGAN. Finally, the LeNet network is trained based on the extended data. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme greatly improve the sensing accuracy.

The primary challenge is correctly classifying digits which are highly varied in their visual characteristics primarily due to the writing styles of different individuals. In this paper, we propose the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the purpose of classifying handwritten Bangla and Hindi numerals. The major advantage that we face by using a CNN-based classifier is that no prior hand-crafted feature needs to be extracted from the images for efficient and accurate classification. An added benefit of a CNN classifier is that it provides translational invariance and a certain extent of rotational invariance during recognition. Applications can be found in real-time OCR systems where input images are often not perfectly oriented along a vertical axis. In this work, we use modified versions of the well-known LeNet CNN architecture. Extensive experiments have revealed a best-case classification accuracy of 98.2% for Bangla and 98.8% for Hindi numerals outperforming competitive models in the literature.","[Mukhoti, Jishnu; Dutta, Sukanya; Sarkar, Ram] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kolkata, India",,"Mukhoti, J (corresponding author), Jadavpur Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kolkata, India.",omegafragger@gmail.com,"Sarkar, Ram/AAX-3822-2020","Sarkar, Ram/0000-0001-8813-4086",,,,,26,6,6,1,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0883-9514,1087-6545,,APPL ARTIF INTELL,Appl.

To efficiently deploy convolutional neural network (CNN) models on the edge device, energy-aware model compression becomes extremely important. However, existing work did not study this problem well because of the lack of considering the diversity of dataflow types in hardware architectures. In this article, we propose EDCompress (EDC), an energy-aware model compression method for various dataflows. It can effectively reduce the energy consumption of various edge devices, with different dataflow types. Considering the very nature of model compression procedures, we recast the optimization process to a multistep problem and solve it by reinforcement learning algorithms. We also propose a multidimensional multistep (MDMS) optimization method, which shows higher compressing capability than the traditional multistep method. Experiments show that EDC could improve 20x, 17x, and 26x energy efficiency in VGG-16, MobileNet, and LeNet-5 networks, respectively, with negligible loss of accuracy. EDC could also indicate the optimal dataflow type for specific neural networks in terms of energy consumption, which can guide the deployment of CNN on hardware.","[Wang, Zhehui; Luo, Tao; Goh, Rick Siow Mong; Zhou, Joey Tianyi] ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore 138632, Singapore",,"Zhou, JT (corresponding author), ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp, Singapore 138632, Singapore.",wang_zhehui@ihpc.a-star.edu.sg; luo_tao@ihpc.a-star.edu.sg; gohsm@ihpc.a-star.edu.sg; joey_zhou@ihpc.a-star.edu.sg,,"Zhou, Joey Tianyi/0000-0002-4675-7055; Luo, Tao/0000-0002-3415-3676","SERC Central Research Fund (Use-inspired Basic Research); Singapore Government's Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 Plan (Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering domain) [A1687b0033, A1892b0026, A18A1b0045]","SERC Central Research Fund (Use-inspired Basic Research); Singapore Government's Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 Plan (Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering domain)","The work of Joey Tianyi Zhou supported in part by the SERC Central Research Fund (Use-inspired Basic Research) and the Singapore Government's Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 Plan (Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering domain) under Grant A1687b0033, Grant A1892b0026, and Grant A18A1b0045.",,47,1,1,1,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2162-237X,2162-2388,,IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR,IEEE Trans.

To mitigate the exponential quality degradation at low swings, sub-word ranking and non-uniform swing allocation are introduced. An efficient swing selection to exploit local variations is presented. The proposed links also outperform approximate links in terms of energy and its variability at ISO-quality, while allowing full-quality execution when needed. The proposed techniques are demonstrated in a 28-nm testchip with differential and voltage-scaled standard CMOS links. Results on 20 dies and 3200 links under neural network (LeNet-5 and AlexNet) and computer vision workloads show that the energy can be reduced by up to 5.1X on average across 20 dies, compared with a conventionally designed link.

In this article, we study repeatability when training deep learning models for segmentation and classification tasks using U-Net and LeNet-5 architectures in two development environments Pytorch and Keras (with TensorFlow backend). We show that even with the available control of randomization in Keras and TensorFlow, there are uncontrolled randomizations.

Over the past decade, researchers have demonstrated the possibilities to automate the initial lesion detection. However, the lack of a common dataset impedes research when comparing the performance of such algorithms. This paper proposes the use of deep learning approaches for breast ultrasound lesion detection and investigates three different methods: a Patch-based LeNet, a U-Net, and a transfer learning approach with a pretrained FCN-AlexNet. Their performance is compared against four state-of-the-art lesion detection algorithms (i.e., Radial Gradient Index, Multifractal Filtering, Rule-based Region Ranking, and Deformable Part Models). In addition, this paper compares and contrasts two conventional ultrasound image datasets acquired from two different ultrasound systems. Dataset A comprises 306 (60 malignant and 246 benign) images and Dataset B comprises 163 (53 malignant and 110 benign) images. To overcome the lack of public datasets in this domain, Dataset B will be made available for research purposes. The results demonstrate an overall improvement by the deep learning approaches when assessed on both datasets in terms of True Positive Fraction, False Positives per image, and F-measure.","[Yap, Moi Hoon] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Comp Math & Digital Technol, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England; [Pons, Gerard] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Barcelona 08018, Spain; [Marti, Joan; Marti, Robert] Univ Girona, Dept Comp Sci, Girona 17071, Spain; [Ganau, Sergi; Sentis, Melcior] Corporacio Parc Tauli, Radiol Dept, UDIAT Ctr Diagnost, Sabadell 08208, Spain; [Zwiggelaar, Reyer] Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 3DB, Dyfed, Wales; [Davison, Adrian K.] Univ Manchester, Fac Biol Med & Hlth, Ctr Imaging Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",,"Yap, MH (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sch Comp Math & Digital Technol, Manchester M1 5GD, Lancs, England.",m.yap@mmu.ac.uk; gponsro@uoc.edu; MSentis@tauli.cat; rrz@aber.ac.uk; adrian.davison@manchester.ac.uk; robert.marti@udg.edu,"Davison, Adrian/AAV-2268-2020; Martí, Robert/H-7917-2015","Davison, Adrian/0000-0002-6496-0209; Martí, Robert/0000-0002-8080-2710; Ganau, Sergi/0000-0002-6586-1712; Sentis, Melcior/0000-0002-2547-6932; Pons, Gerard/0000-0001-7671-2547; Yap, Moi Hoon/0000-0001-7681-4287",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under Project SMARTER [DPI2015-68442-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under Project SMARTER,This work was supported in part by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under Project SMARTER (DPI2015-68442-R).

Firstly, we analyze the cyclic autocorrelation of an OFDM signal and the cyclic spectrum obtained by the time domain smoothing fast Fourier transformation (FFT) accumulation algorithm (FAM), and the cyclic spectrum is normalized to gray scale processing to form a cyclic autocorrelation gray scale image. Then, we learn the deep features of layer-by-layer extraction by the improved CNN classic LeNet-5 model. Finally, we input the test set to verify the trained CNN model. Simulation experiments show that this method can complete the spectrum sensing task by taking advantage of the cycle spectrum, which has better spectrum sensing performance for OFDM signals under a low signal-noise ratio (SNR) than traditional methods.","[Pan, Guangliang] Qilu Univ Technol, Shandong Acad Sci, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Jinan 250353, Peoples R China; [Li, Jun; Lin, Fei] Qilu Univ Technol, Shandong Acad Sci, Dept Phys, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Jinan 250353, Peoples R China",,"Li, J (corresponding author), Qilu Univ Technol, Shandong Acad Sci, Dept Phys, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Jinan 250353, Peoples R China.",rogerjunli@sdu.edu.cn,,"Li, Jun/0000-0001-5099-3475; Pan, Guangliang/0000-0001-5930-5827",Shandong Ship Control Engineering and Intelligent System Engineering Research Center 2019 Open Special Fund Project [SSCC-2019-0007],Shandong Ship Control Engineering and Intelligent System Engineering Research Center 2019 Open Special Fund Project,This work was supported by the Shandong Ship Control Engineering and Intelligent System Engineering Research Center 2019 Open Special Fund Project (SSCC-2019-0007).,,28,5,5,1,11,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-7578,1687-7586,,INT J DIGIT MULTIMED,Int.

In this work, we propose an approach to rain detection using image processing techniques and Convolutional Neuronal Networks (CNN). In order to improve the results of classification, images in rain and no rain conditions are pre-processed using the Sobel algorithm to detect edges. The architecture that defines the CNN is LeNet and it is carried out with three convolutional layers, three pooling layers and a soft max layer. With the proposed method, it is possible to detect the presence of rain in certain region of the image with an accuracy of 89%.

Loss function, as a supervisory signal to learn a CNN model, plays an important role in obtaining the desired facial features. However, how to design a loss function to make the features more compact and discriminative for unconstrained face recognition, is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose two novel loss functions, Compact Discriminative loss and Advanced Compact Discriminative loss. They supervise CNN to map the raw data onto the face feature space, where the intra-class space is compact and inter-class spaces have sensible gaps, by constraining the intra-class variations and the inter-class variations simultaneously. Three CNNs (i.e. LeNet, CNN-M and ResNet-50) are used to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, the obtained models are evaluated on several famous benchmark databases, such as MNIST, LFW, FGLFW, YTF and IJB-A.

One may think a black box classifier is robust enough against misclassification attacks. We demonstrate that black box classifier is still vulnerable to our proposed misclassification attack. We conceal the details of classifier. The only thing an adversary can do is to query samples' classification results. We proposed a particle swarm optimization based misclassification attack.

Handwritten character recognition is one of the typical problem which has shown promising results using several neural networks. Classification of handwritten characters is primarily a two-step problem where we need to obtain the features from the data set and then applying a classifier to recognize the characters. We have proposed a Center of Gravity (CG) based quad-partitioning of images to extract Histogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG) features which are normally calculated over equally partitioned images. These modified HOG features are used to extract more local shape of the handwritten Tibetan characters, a newly introduced dataset. ELM is then applied for classification the characters. We have also compared our result with traditional HOG features across five popular classifiers for handwritten Tibetan characters.

From a machine learning perspective, this type of problems has been addressed using models trained in different specific domains as the starting point for the final objective-model. The transfer of knowledge between domains, known as transfer learning (TL), helps to speed up training and improve the performance of the models in problems with limited amounts of data. In this letter, we introduce a TL approach to classify isolated volcano-seismic signals at Volcan de Fuego, Colima (Mexico). Using the well-known convolutional architecture (LeNet) as a feature extractor and a representative data set containing regional earthquakes, volcano-tectonic earthquakes, long-period events, volcanic tremors, explosions, and collapses, our proposal compares the generalization capabilities of the models when we only fine-tune the upper layers and fine-tune overall of them. Compared with the other state-of-the-art techniques, classification systems based on TL approaches provide good generalization capabilities (attaining nearly 94% of events correctly classified) and decreasing computational time resources.","[Titos, Manuel; Bueno, Angel; Garcia, Luz; Benitez, Carmen; Segura, J.

A probabilistic inference network that performs recurrent belief propagation is developed to post process the recognition results of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) (e.g. LeNet) and form individual characters to words. The post processing has the capability of correcting deletion, insertion and replacement errors in a noisy input. The output of the inference network is a set of words with their probability of being the correct one. To limit the size of candidate words, a series of improvements have been made to the probabilistic inference network, including using a post Gaussian Mixture Estimation model to prune insignificant words.

To address these issues, FPGAs are commonly used to implement CNNs because of their high flexibility and low power consumption. The Winograd convolution algorithm can be used to further reduce the computation requirements of a convolution operation. This paper proposes the Winograd Offline-Runtime Decomposition Algorithm (WORDA), which provides an efficient approach to performing Winograd convolution to achieve low computation latency. In this work, WORDA is used to design convolution layers for CNN accelerators on FPGA for two CNN architectures, namely LeNet and AlexNet, using Vivado HLS (High Level Synthesis). The state-of-the-art comparison shows a 583% decrease in latency while only incurring a constant increase in BRAMs, no change in DSPs, and a 122% increase in flip-flops (FFs) and lookup tables (LUTs) usage when using filters of size 5 x 5.","[Nelson, Jacob; Odetola, Tolulope; Hasan, Syed Rafay] Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA",,"Nelson, J (corresponding author), Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA.",jmnelson42@tntech.edu; taodetola42@tntech.edu; shasan@tntech.edu,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1548-3746,1558-3899,978-1-6654-2461-5,MIDWEST SYMP CIRCUIT,,,2021.0,,,,,,,46,49,,10.1109/MWSCAS47672.2021.9531783,0.0,,,4,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BS9ZN,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000784758700011,0

However, current designs still require high energy consumption on photoelectric conversion and analog data movement. In this paper, two methods are proposed to improve the energy efficiency of in-sensor-processing architecture, including direct photocurrent computation and 2D kernel scheduling. Photocurrents are directly involved in computation to avoid data conversion; thus the indispensable imaging power is also utilized for computing. Since the location of the pixel data is fixed, data scheduling is conducted on digital weights to eliminate analog data storage and movement. We implement a prototype chip with an array of 32 x 32 units to calculate the first layer of binarized LeNet-5.

In the training processing, we discuss both the deterministic and stochastic feature representations, and investigate the performance of them and the ensemble model.

This paper explores the network structure suitable for the evaluation of geometric artifacts in CT images. We select three commonly used networks LeNet-5, VGG16 and AlexNet. The datasets of three kinds of phantoms are constructed using simulation and actual scanning results. The three networks are trained and tested separately on the three kinds of datasets.

Two methods of pre-processing are evaluated, quantization and sharpness enhancement. Quantization carries out at 7 levels, and sharpness works with four levels using the discrete wavelet transform.

However, because DNNs are built upon a rich data-driven programming paradigm that employs plenty of labeled data to train a set of neurons to construct the internal system logic, analyzing and understanding their behaviors becomes a difficult task for software engineers. In this paper, we present an instance-based visualization tool for DNN, namely NeuralVis, to support software engineers in visualizing and interpreting deep learning models. NeuralVis is designed for: 1). visualizing the structure of DNN models, i.e., neurons, layers, as well as connections; 2). visualizing the data transformation process; 3). integrating existing adversarial attack algorithms for test input generation; 4). comparing intermediate layers' outputs of different inputs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuralVis, we design a task-based user study involving ten participants on two classic DNN models, i.e., LeNet and VGG-12. The result shows NeuralVis can assist engineers in identifying critical features that determine the prediction results.

In order to achieve the best possible results, tuning of the network's hyperparameters is necessary but that represents an exponentially hard optimization problem with computationally very expensive fitness function. The swarm intelligence algorithms have been proven to be effective in solving such exponentially hard optimization problems, however their application to this particular problem has not been sufficiently studied. In this paper, convolutional neural network hyperparameters were tuned by the bare bones fireworks algorithm.

The method divides a single enormous task into multiple modules and running each module on different FPGA as the pipeline structure between hoards. In addition, considering the impact of communication delay between boards, it is proposed to use the delay between development boards as a separate stage of the pipeline. In this way, we can minimize a stage's runtime of module level pipeline. In order to evaluate the calculate capacity of per hardware resource, the concept of resource conversion efficiency (RCE) is proposed.

In this paper, we proposed an efficient attention-based image adversarial attack algorithm with differential evolution on realistic high-resolution images that make changes negligible to human eye but can achieve great success in deceiving Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) such as LeNet and ResNet. This attention-based algorithm uses the theory of Region of Interest (ROI) in the image and reduce the search area accordingly to maximize the attack accuracy. This paper proposed two image perturbation methods: strike-slip attack and Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) filter attack, which apply changes universally to a given area of pixels to minimize the visual difference between two adjacent pixels.

Not only does the synapse respond to electrical voltage spikes due to charge trapping/detrapping, but also the weight is modified directly by persistent photocurrent effects under UV-light stimulation. Representative forms of synaptic plasticity, including inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents, frequency-dependent characteristics, short-term to long-term plasticity transitions, and summation effects, are successfully demonstrated. In particular, optoelectronic synergetic modulation leads to reconfigurable excitatory and inhibitory synaptic behaviors, which provides a promising way to achieve the homeostatic regulation of synaptic weights. Moreover, the analogue channel conductance with 100 states is used as the weight update rule to perform MNIST handwritten digit recognition, using system-level LeNet-5 convolutional neural network simulations.

While the performance of CNNs has been excellent, their implementation complexity has, however, always posed a challenge due to their computational and memory access intensive nature of CNNs especially for resource constrained embedded platforms. In this paper, we propose a novel reduced-parameter CNN architecture that can be used for image classification applications, which results in a significant network model size reduction. Our reduction method, inspired by SqueezeNet, replaces convolutional layer kernels with smaller sized kernels and removes all the fully connected layers other than the last classifying layer.

However, degradation of the diagnostic accuracy and operational speed has been significant due to unfavorable working conditions and increasing network depth. An improved version of ResNets is proposed in this paper to address these issues. The advantages of the proposed network are presented as follows. Firstly, a multi-scale feature fusion block was designed, to extract multi-scale fault feature information. Secondly, an improved residual block based on depthwise separable convolution was used to improve the operational speed and alleviate the computational burden of the network. The effectiveness of the proposed network was validated by discriminating between diverse health states in a gearbox under normal and noisy conditions. The experimental results show that the proposed network model has a higher classification accuracy than the classical convolutional neural networks, LeNet-5, AlexNet and ResNets and a faster calculation speed than the classical deep neural networks.

Hence, in this paper, we proposed a machine learning-based design space exploration method for dynamic random-access memory and non-volatile memory systems. We applied our method to the CosmoGAN and LeNet applications to predict the following six memory response parameters: (i) bandwidth, (ii) power, (iii) average latency, (iv) average total latency, (v) memory reads, and (vi) memory writes. Our experimental results show that machine learning models can predict memory response parameter values faster than simulations. We used support vector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting machine learning models. We observed that the support vector machine provides better performance for bandwidth, average latency, and average total latency. The random forest model works better for memory reads and writes. The gradient boosting model provides superior prediction performance for power. We provide a detailed discussion on learning curve characteristics, error analysis, and memory type recommendation.","[Hasan, S. M.

In this work, we evaluate three common decisions that need to be made by a CNN designer, namely the performance of transfer learning, the effect of object/image size and the relation between training set size. We evaluate three CNN models, namely one based on LeNet, and two based on the Fire module from SqueezeNet. Our findings are: Transfer learning with an SVM works very well, even when the train and transfer sets have no classes in common, and high classification performance can be obtained even when the target dataset is small. The ADAM optimizer combined with Batch Normalization can make a high accuracy CNN classifier, even with small image sizes (16 pixels). At least 50 samples per class are required to obtain 90% test accuracy, and using Dropout with a small dataset helps improve performance, but Batch Normalization is better when a large dataset is available.","[Valdenegro-Toro, Matias] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Ocean Syst Lab, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",,"Valdenegro-Toro, M (corresponding author), Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Engn & Phys Sci, Ocean Syst Lab, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",m.valdenegro@hw.ac.uk,"Valdenegro, Matias/AAR-9440-2020",,FP7-PEOPLE-ITN project ROBOCADEMY - European Commission [608096],FP7-PEOPLE-ITN project ROBOCADEMY - European Commission(European Commission),This work has been partially supported by the FP7-PEOPLE-2013-ITN project ROBOCADEMY (Ref 608096) funded by the European Commission.,,12,7,7,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0197-7385,,978-1-5090-5278-3,OCEANS-IEEE,,,2017.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,"Acoustics; Engineering, Marine; Oceanography",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Acoustics; Engineering; Oceanography,BJ7BS,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000426997002077,0

However, recent studies have highlighted the extreme sensitivity and vulnerability of modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to adversarial examples. While being imperceptible and benign to the naked human eye, those adversarial perturbations crafted from one-pixel attacks can drastically impact the accuracy of DNNs. The consequences of those adversarial attacks in critical applications such as healthcare and autonomous vehicles can prove disastrous. Therefore, the urge to ensure the robustness and resilience of DL systems against one-pixel attacks has recently started attracting stupendous attention from both academicians and industry professionals. Throughout this paper, we first develop a one-pixel threat model within an IIoT ecosystem and propose a novel image recovery defense mechanism to detect and mitigate one-pixel attacks based on Accelerated Proximal Gradient approach. Experimental results proved that our proposed solution is highly effective and efficient in detecting and mitigating one-pixel attacks in state-of-the-art neural networks, more specifically LeNet and ResNet, using the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets.","[Husnoo, Muhammad Akbar; Anwar, Adnan] Deakin Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Ctr Cyber Secur Res & Innovat CSRI, Geelong, Vic 3216, Australia",,"Anwar, A (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Ctr Cyber Secur Res & Innovat CSRI, Geelong, Vic 3216, Australia.",mahusnoo@deakin.edu.au; adnan.anwar@deakin.edu.au,,"Anwar, Adnan/0000-0003-3916-1381; Husnoo, Muhammad Akbar/0000-0001-7908-8807",,,,,42,2,2,1,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1570-8705,1570-8713,,AD HOC NETW,Ad Hoc Netw.,NOV 1,2021.0,122,,,,,,,,102627,10.1016/j.adhoc.2021.102627,0.0,,AUG 2021,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Telecommunications,WC6LQ,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000704368100005,0

In recent times Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have proved to be amazingly useful for that task. The drawback, however, is that 3D brain images contain a huge amount of information that leads to complex CNN architectures. When these architectures become too complex, classification performances often degrades because the limitations of the training algorithm and overfitting. Thus, this paper proposes the use of isosurfaces as a way to reduce such amount of data while keeping the most relevant information. These isosurfaces are then used to implement a classification system which uses two of the most well-known CNN architectures, LeNet and AlexNet, to classify DaTScan images with an average accuracy of 95.1% and AUC = 97%, obtaining comparable (slightly better) values to those obtained for most of the recently proposed systems. It can be concluded therefore that the computation of isosurfaces reduces the complexity of the inputs significantly, resulting in high classification accuracies with reduced computational burden.","[Ortiz, Andres; Munilla, Jorge; Martinez-Ibanez, Manuel] Univ Malaga, Dept Commun Engn, Malaga, Spain; [Gorriz, Juan M.; Ramirez, Javier; Salas-Gonzalez, Diego] Univ Granada, Dept Signal Theory Networking & Commun, Granada, Spain",,"Munilla, J (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Dept Commun Engn, Malaga, Spain.",munilla@ic.uma.es,"Gorriz, Juan Manuel/C-2385-2012; Salas-Gonzalez, Diego/H-5847-2015; Ramírez, Javier/B-1836-2012; Ortiz, Andrés/K-4886-2014; Salas-Gonzalez, Diego/AAD-8677-2019","Gorriz, Juan Manuel/0000-0001-7069-1714; Salas-Gonzalez, Diego/0000-0001-5618-7140; Ramírez, Javier/0000-0002-6229-2921; Salas-Gonzalez, Diego/0000-0001-5618-7140","MINECO/FEDER [TEC2015-64718-R, PSI2015-65848-R, PGC2018-098813-B-C32, RTI2018-098913-B-100]; NVIDIA Corporation",MINECO/FEDER(Spanish Government); NVIDIA Corporation,"This work was partly supported by the MINECO/FEDER under TEC2015-64718-R, PSI2015-65848-R, PGC2018-098813-B-C32, and RTI2018-098913-B-100 projects.

To overcome this problem, this work proposes a power-efficient accelerator for CNNs, and different methods are applied to optimize the convolutional layers and fully connected layers. For the convolutional layer, the accelerator first rearranges the input features into matrix on-the-fly when storing them to the on-chip buffers. Thus the computation of convolutional layer can be completed through matrix multiplication. For the fully connected layer, the batch-based method is used to reduce the required memory bandwidth, which also can be completed through matrix multiplication. Then a two-layer pipelined computation method for matrix multiplication is proposed to increase the throughput. As a case study, we implement a widely used CNN model, LeNet-5, on an embedded device.

In this paper, a Sequential Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) model consisting of CNN and bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) is proposed, which performs exceptionally well with small numbers of histopatho-logical osteosarcoma Haematoxylin and Eosin (H & E) stained images despite having the over-fitting problem, heterogeneity, intra-class variation, inter-class similarity, crowded context, the irregular shape of the nucleus and noisy data. Performance of the is compared with that of AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16, LeNet and SVM models with the histopathological image dataset on osteosarcoma.","[Nabid, Rahad Arman; Rahman, Md Latifur; Hossain, Md Farhad] Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Dhaka 1205, Bangladesh",,"Nabid, RA (corresponding author), Bangladesh Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Dhaka 1205, Bangladesh.",ran.nabid@gmail.com; alif.eee.buet@gmail.com; mfarhadhossain@eee.buet.ac.bd,,,,,,,15,5,5,2,8,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-6654-2254-3,,,,2020.0,,,,,,,363,366,851,10.1109/ICECE51571.2020.9393159,0.0,,,4,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BR7QG,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000668966200091,0

However, the existing studies did not take into account the hierarchical structures of deep neural networks in designing the adaptation strategies. Meanwhile, the issue of balancing adaptiveness and convergence is still an open question to be answered. In this study, we investigate novel adaptive learning rate strategies at different levels based on the hyper-gradient descent framework and propose a method that adaptively learns the optimizer parameters by combining adaptive information at different levels. In addition, we show the relationship between regularizing over-parameterized learning rates and building combinations of adaptive learning rates at different levels. Moreover, two heuristics are introduced to guarantee the convergence of the proposed optimizers.

However, the current CNN-based fault diagnosis studies usually consider features or images extracted from a single domain as model input. This single domain information may not reflect fault patterns comprehensively, leading to low modeling accuracy and inaccurate diagnostic results. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a new CNN-based fault diagnosis approach using image representation considering multi-domain features of vibration signals. First, multi-domain features of vibration signals are extracted. These extracted features are then used to construct an x n matrix, and subsequently to form images by RGB color transformations. This image transformation technique allows for capturing complementary and rich diagnostic information from multiple domains. At last, these images associated with different mechanical defects are fed into a CNN model that is improved based on the classic LeNet-5 CNN architecture for fault diagnosis and identification. Comparative experiments with the traditional feature extraction methods as well as state-of-the-art CNN-based methods are also investigated.

However, compact nanodevices implementing non-linear activation functions are required for efficient full-hardware implementation of deep neural networks. Here, we present an energy-efficient and compact Mott activation neuron based on vanadium dioxide and its successful integration with a conductive bridge random access memory (CBRAM) crossbar array in hardware. The Mott activation neuron implements the rectified linear unit function in the analogue domain. The neuron devices consume substantially less energy and occupy two orders of magnitude smaller area than those of analogue complementary metal-oxide semiconductor implementations. The LeNet-5 network with Mott activation neurons achieves 98.38% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, close to the ideal software accuracy. We perform large-scale image edge detection using the Mott activation neurons integrated with a CBRAM crossbar array. Our findings provide a solution towards large-scale, highly parallel and energy-efficient in-memory computing systems for neural networks. Energy- and area-efficient vanadium-dioxide-based Mott activation neuron devices enable the implementation of activation functions in neural networks.","[Oh, Sangheon; Shi, Yuhan; Lu, Yichen; Huang, Zhisheng; Kuzum, Duygu] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [del Valle, Javier; Salev, Pavel; Kalcheim, Yoav; Schuller, Ivan K.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,"Kuzum, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dkuzum@eng.ucsd.edu,"del Valle, Javier/ABF-9903-2021; Lu, Yichen/AAL-9421-2020","del Valle, Javier/0000-0002-6210-5321; Lu, Yichen/0000-0002-1508-2454","Office of Naval Research [N000142012405, N00014162531]; Samsung Electronics; National Science Foundation [ECCS-1542148, ECCS-1752241, ECCS-2024776, ECCS-1734940]; National Institutes of Health [R21 EY029466, R21 EB026180, DP2 EB030992]; Qualcomm Fellowship; Quantum Materials for Energy Efficient Neuromorphic Computing (Q-MEEN-C) Energy Frontier Research Center (EFRC) - US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences [DE-SC0019273]","Office of Naval Research(Office of Naval Research); Samsung Electronics(Samsung); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Qualcomm Fellowship; Quantum Materials for Energy Efficient Neuromorphic Computing (Q-MEEN-C) Energy Frontier Research Center (EFRC) - US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work was supported by Office of Naval Research (N000142012405 and N00014162531), Samsung Electronics, the National Science Foundation (ECCS-1752241, ECCS-2024776 and ECCS-1734940), the National Institutes of Health (R21 EY029466, R21 EB026180 and DP2 EB030992) and Qualcomm Fellowship.

In this paper, we consider the application of federated learning in wireless networks featuring uplink multiuser multiple-input and multiple-output (MU-MIMO), and aim at optimizing the communication efficiency during the aggregation of client-side updates by exploiting the inherent superposition of radio frequency (RF) signals. We propose a novel approach named Physical-Layer Arithmetic (PhyArith), where the clients encode their local updates into aligned digital sequences which are converted into RF signals for sending to the server simultaneously, and the server directly recovers the exact summation of these updates as required from the superimposed RF signal by employing a customized sum-product algorithm. PhyArith is compatible with commodity devices due to the use of full digital operation in both the client-side encoding and the server-side decoding processes, and can also be integrated with other updates compression based acceleration techniques. Simulation results show that PhyArith further improves the communication efficiency by 1.5 to 3 times for training LeNet-5, compared with solutions only applying updates compression.","[Huang, Tao; Ye, Baoliu; Tang, Bin; Xie, Lei; Lu, Sanglu] Nanjing Univ, Natl Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Qu, Zhihao] Hohai Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Ye, BL; Tang, B (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Natl Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",schrodinger.huang@gmail.com; yebl@nju.edu.cn; quzhihao@hhu.edu.cn; tb@nju.edu.cn; lxie@nju.edu.cn; sanglu@nju.edu.cn,,,"National K&D Program of China [2018YFB1004704]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61832005, 61872171, 61872174]; Key R&D of Jiangsu Province [BE2017152]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20190058]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M661709]; Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization",National K&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key R&D of Jiangsu Province; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization,"This work was supported in part by the National K&D Program of China under Grant 2018YFB1004704, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61832005, Grant 61872171, and Grant 61872174, in part by the Key R&D of Jiangsu Province under Grant BE2017152, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Grant BK20190058, in part by Project funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant 2019M661709, and in part by the Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization.",,24,6,6,0,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0743-166X,,978-1-7281-6412-0,IEEE INFOCOM SER,,,2020.0,,,,,,,1221,1230,,,,,,10,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,BQ8NB,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000620945800124,0

Therefore, this paper first presents a brief overview of various security threats in machine learning, their respective threat models and associated research challenges to develop robust security measures. To illustrate the security vulnerabilities of ML during training, inferencing and hardware implementation, we demonstrate some key security threats on ML using LeNet and VGGNet for MNIST and German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmarks (GTSRB), respectively.

We firstly use an average pooling and 1 x 1 convolutional layer to replace fully connected layers. Meanwhile, depthwise separation convolution is utilized to replace traditional convolution to further reduce the number of parameters. Furthermore, a network pruning method is adopted to remove the redundant memristor crossbars for depthwise separation convolutional layers. Therefore, a more compact network structure is obtained while the recognition accuracy remaining unchanged. Simulation results show that the designed model achieves superior accuracy rates while greatly reducing the scale of the hardware circuit.

Because of the unique nonvolatility and programmability, the memristor is an ideal nano-device to realize neural synapses in VLSI circuit implementation of neural networks. However, in the hardware implementation, the performance of the memristive neural network is always affected by quantization error, writing error, and conductance drift, which seriously hinders its applications in practice. In this paper, a novel weight optimization scheme combining quantization and Bayesian inference is proposed to alleviate this problem. Specifically, the weight deviation in the memristive neural network is transformed into the weight uncertainty in the Bayesian neural network, which can make the network insensitive to unexpected weight changes. A quantization regularization term is designed and utilized during the training process of the Bayesian neural network, reducing the quantization error and improving the robustness of the network. Furthermore, a partial training method is raised to extend the applicability of the proposed scheme in large-scale neural networks. Finally, the experiments on a Multilayer Perceptron and LeNet demonstrate that the proposed weight optimization scheme can significantly enhance the robustness of memristive neural networks.","[Zhou, Yue; Wang, Lidan] Southwest Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xiaofang; Zhou, Guangdong; Duan, Shukai] Southwest Univ, Coll Artificial Intelligence, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China",,"Duan, SK (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Coll Artificial Intelligence, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.",duansk@swu.edu.cn,"Wang, Lidan/H-5117-2013","Wang, Lidan/0000-0003-0730-4202; Zhou, Yue/0000-0002-0344-3080","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB1306600]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U20A20227, 61976246, 62076207, 62076208]; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing [cstc2020jcyj-msxmX0385]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing(Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing),"This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018YFB1306600; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U20A20227, Grant 61976246, Grant 62076207, and Grant 62076208; and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing under Grant cstc2020jcyj-msxmX0385.",,51,6,6,13,21,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1549-8328,1558-0806,,IEEE T CIRCUITS-I,IEEE Trans.

This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network with one-dimensional structure (ODCNN) for the automatical fault diagnosis of rolling bearings, which adopts six sets of convolutional and max-pooling layers to extract signal features and applies a flattening convolutional layer followed by two fully-connected layers for feature classification. The architectures of one-dimensional LeNet-5, AlexNet, and the proposed ODCNN are illustrated in detail, followed by the obtaining of training and testing samples, which is pre-processed by overlapping the vibration signals of rolling bearings.

However, the imperfect fabrication process combined with stochastic filament-based switching leads to resistance variations, which can significantly affect the weights in binary synapses and degrade the accuracy of NNs. Further, as multi-level cells (MLCs) are being developed for reducing hardware overhead, the NN accuracy deteriorates more due to the resistance variations in the binary coding. In this paper, a novel unary coding of synaptic weights is presented to overcome the resistance variations of MLCs and achieve reliable ReRAM-based neuromorphic computing. The priority mapping is also proposed in compliance with the unary coding to guarantee high accuracy by mapping those bits with lower resistance states to ReRAMs with smaller resistance variations. Our experimental results show that the proposed method provides less than 0.45% and 5.48% accuracy loss on LeNet (on MNIST dataset) and VGG16 (on CIFAR-10 dataset), respectively, with acceptable hardware cost.","[Ma, Chang; Sun, Yanan; Jiang, Li] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Qian, Weikang; Meng, Ziqi; Yang, Rui] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Univ Michigan Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ Joint Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Qian, Weikang; Jiang, Li] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, MoE Key Lab Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,"Ma, C (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",sunyanan@sjtu.edu.cn; qianwk@sjtu.edu.cn; Ijiang_cs@sjtu.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB1403400]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61704104]; Shanghai Sailing Program [17Z111260004],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Sailing Program,"This work was partially supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFB1403400), National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant No. 61704104 and Shanghai Sailing Program under Grant No. 17Z111260004.

Comparisons were made using the recognition rates achieved with five real data sets from industrial applications. The results showed that not pre-trained neural networks produce worse results than classical classifiers with the given small amounts of data for training. On the other hand, the pre-trained networks achieved surpassing recognition rates. However, if there are features that describe the classes very well, the recognition performance of classical machine learning methods little differs from that of deep learning algorithms.","[Anding, K.; Haar, L.; Polte, G.; Walz, J.; Notni, G.] Ilmenau Univ Technol, Gustav Kirchhoff Pl 2, D-98693 Ilmenau, Germany",,"Anding, K (corresponding author), Ilmenau Univ Technol, Gustav Kirchhoff Pl 2, D-98693 Ilmenau, Germany.",katharina.anding@tu-ilmenau.de,"Polte, Galina/AAC-5761-2020","Polte, Galina/0000-0002-0255-4133",Free State of Thuringia [2017 FE 9111]; European Union; federal ministry of education and research [03IPT709X],Free State of Thuringia(European Commission); European Union(European Commission); federal ministry of education and research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The current research projects, which form the basis of this paper, are OptoCheck (project no.: 2017 FE 9111), funded by the Free State of Thuringia and co-financed by the European Union under the European Regional Development Fund (EFRE), and Qualimess next generation (03IPT709X), funded by the federal ministry of education and research.

Similarly, tactile sensing-based information acquisition systems in robots can help enhance the interactions of robots with the surroundings. The main drawback of morphology and texture sensing methods is their inability to explain and quantify sensing information, which makes it difficult to utilize prior knowledge and necessitates a new training process to fit the new task, even if the changes between the existing and new tasks are minuscule. Another drawback is its dependence on large datasets. To solve these problems, a hybrid connectionist symbolic model (HCSM) is proposed herein that combines historic symbolic knowledge and end-to-end neural networks. The symbolic model requires a smaller dataset and possesses an improved transferability of detection. Neural networks can be easily established and exhibit better fault tolerance for non-ideal samples. The HCSM model combines these advantages. Experiments with the tactile-based morphology and texture detection demonstrated that the new method can transfer the detection ability to fit new tasks without requiring additional retraining and has a 16% higher recognition precision than a convolutional neural network, LeNet, AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet. The HCSM method with these features can broaden the range of applications of tactile sensing.","[He, Kai; Yu, Peng; Wang, Wenxue; Zhao, Liang; Yang, Tie; Liu, Lianqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenyang Inst Automat, Inst Robot, State Key Lab Robot, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [He, Kai; Yu, Peng; Wang, Wenxue; Zhao, Liang; Yang, Tie; Liu, Lianqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Intelligent Mfg, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; [He, Kai] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Xi, Ning] Univ Hong Kong, Emerging Inst Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Xi, Ning] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Elhaj, Imad H.] Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Beirut 11072020, Lebanon",,"Liu, LQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shenyang Inst Automat, Inst Robot, State Key Lab Robot, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.;Liu, LQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Intelligent Mfg, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China.",hekai@sia.cn; xining@hku.hk; yupeng@sia.cn; wangwenxue@sia.cn; zhaoliang@sia.cn; yangtie@sia.cn; ie05@aub.edu.lb; lqliu@sia.cn,,"Liu, Lianqing/0000-0002-2271-5870; wang, wen xue/0000-0002-9137-8302","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFE0206200]; National Natural Science ofChina [61821005, 91748212]; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province of China [20180520035]; Sichuan Science and Technology Program [2020YFSY0012]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science ofChina(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province); Sichuan Science and Technology Program,"This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2016YFE0206200, in part by the National Natural Science ofChina under Grant 61821005 and Grant 91748212, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province of China under Grant 20180520035, and in part by the Sichuan Science and Technology Program under Grant 2020YFSY0012.",,31,0,0,4,19,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1530-437X,1558-1748,,IEEE SENS J,IEEE Sens.

However, the improved performance of additional layers in a deep network comes at the cost of added latency and energy usage in feedforward inference. As networks continue to get deeper and larger, these costs become more prohibitive for real-time and energy-sensitive applications. To address this issue, we present BranchyNet, a novel deep network architecture that is augmented with additional side branch classifiers. The architecture allows prediction results for a large portion of test samples to exit the network early via these branches when samples can already be inferred with high confidence. BranchyNet exploits the observation that features learned at an early layer of a network may often be sufficient for the classification of many data points. For more difficult samples, which are expected less frequently, BranchyNet will use further or all network layers to provide the best likelihood of correct prediction. We study the BranchyNet architecture using several well-known networks (LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet) and datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10) and show that it can both improve accuracy and significantly reduce the inference time of the network.","[Teerapittayanon, Surat; McDanel, Bradley; Kung, H.

Many existing studies focus on the training optimization on high-performance servers or computing clusters, e.g. GPU clusters. However, training neural networks on resource-constrained devices, e.g. mobile platforms, is an important research topic barely touched. In this paper, we implement AdaLearneran-adaptive distributed mobile learning system for neural networks that trains a single network with heterogenous mobile resources under the same local network in parallel. To exploit the potential of our system, we adapt neural networks training phase to mobile device-wise resources and fiercely decrease the transmission overhead for better system scalability. On three representative neural network structures trained from two image classification datasets, AdaLearner boosts the training phase significantly. For example, on LeNet, 1.75-3.37x speedup is achieved when increasing the worker nodes from 2 to 8, thanks to the achieved high execution parallelism and excellent scalability.","[Mao, Jiachen; Nixon, Kent W.; Li, Hai; Chen, Yiran] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Qin, Zhuwei; Xu, Zirui; Chen, Xiang] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",,"Mao, JC (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",jiachen.mao@duke.edu; zqin@gmu.edu; zxu21@gmu.edu; kwn8@duke.edu; xchen26@gmu.edu; hai.li@duke.edu; yiran.chen@duke.edu,"Li, Hai/L-8558-2017; Chen, Yiran/L-4812-2017","Li, Hai/0000-0003-3228-6544; Chen, Yiran/0000-0002-1486-8412; Chen, Xiang/0000-0003-2790-976X","NSF [CNS-1717657, SPX-1725456]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported in part by NSF grants CNS-1717657 and SPX-1725456.,,20,6,6,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1933-7760,,978-1-5386-3093-8,ICCAD-IEEE ACM INT,,,2017.0,,,,,,,291,296,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BJ4DB,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000424863100039,0

In this article, we propose Spacedml, a distributed machine learning system for SIN platforms that applies dynamic model compression techniques to adapt distributed machine learning training to SINs' limited bandwidth and unstable connectivity. Spaced-ml has two key algorithm:s adaptive loss-aware quantization, which compresses models without sacrificing their quality, and partial weight averaging, which selectively averages active clients' partial model updates. These algorithms jointly improve communication efficiency and enhance the scalability of distributed machine learning with SIN devices. We evaluate Spacedml by training a LeNet-S model on the MNIST dataset. The experimental results show that Spacedml can increase model accuracy by 2-3 percent and reduce communication bandwidth consumption by up to 60 percent compared to the baseline algorithm.","[Guo, Hanxi; Yang, Qing; Song, Tao; Ma, Ruhui] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Guan, Haibing] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hao] Louisiana State Univ, CSE Div, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Hua, Yang] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",,"Wang, H (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, CSE Div, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",hanxiguo@sjtu.edu.cn; yangqinghush@sjtu.edu.cn; haowang@lsu.edu; Y.Hua@qub.ac.uk; songt333@sjtu.edu.cn; ruhuima@sjtu.edu.cn; hbguan@sjtu.edu.cn,"guan, haibing/G-8142-2011; Wang, Hao/ABA-2658-2021; hua, yang/GSE-0594-2022","guan, haibing/0000-0002-4714-7400; Wang, Hao/0000-0002-1444-2657","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872234, 61732010, 61525204]; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Scalable Computing and Systems",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Key Laboratory of Scalable Computing and Systems,"This work is partially funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 61872234, 61732010, 61525204), Shanghai Key Laboratory of Scalable Computing and Systems.",,15,1,1,1,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0890-8044,1558-156X,,IEEE NETWORK,IEEE Netw.,JUL-AUG,2021.0,35,4,,,,,82,87,,10.1109/MNET.011.2100075,0.0,,,6,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,UF4BY,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000688521300021,0

Therefore, domain adaptive algorithm is needed to improve these models, so that they can be applied successfully. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptive framework codenamed D-DANN inspired by the theory of adversarial learning. We apply the discriminator to diverse the features extracted from dual branch CNN. We can obtain more sufficient shared representation across domains by the proposed dual feature extractors. The framework can be easily adapt to most popular CNN models to improve the representation power. We implement the D-DANN with several popular CNN models including LeNet, AlexNet and so on. Using these D-DANN enhanced neural networks, we conduct extensive experiments on several pairs of domain adaptive validation datasets.

For more accurate classification, the rock part extraction method for rock images containing boundaries is designed to eliminate the influence of background. First, the rock parts are extracted based on the image gradient information and color information, respectively. Then, the two images are intersected to realize the refinement of pixel-level information to obtain a pure rock image. Ensemble ResNet18 (ERN18) is designed as an image classification model. It contains basic blocks to reduce the loss of features during the training process. The method breaks the neglect of most previous studies on background interference. The effect of misclassification in certain regions on the results is eliminated by ensemble learning based on the voting method. The classification results are further improved.

Early detection of these diseases is important to prevent vision impairment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the main imaging technique for detecting these diseases. The model proposed in this work is based on residual blocks and channel attention modules. The performance of the model is evaluated using the publicly available Mendeley OCT dataset and the Duke dataset. We were able to achieve a classification accuracy of 99.5% in the Mendeley test dataset and 94.9% in the Duke dataset with the proposed model. For the application, we performed an extensive evaluation of pre-trained models (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet50 and SE-ResNet). The proposed model has a much smaller number of trainable parameters and shows superior performance compared to existing methods.","[Mathews, Mili Rosline] Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Attingal, Kerala, India; [Mathews, Mili Rosline; Anzar, Sharafudeen Thaha Mohammed] TKM Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Kollam, Kerala, India; [Mathews, Mili Rosline; Anzar, Sharafudeen Thaha Mohammed] APJ Abdul Kalam Technol Univ, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India",,"Mathews, MR (corresponding author), Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Attingal, Kerala, India.",miliroslin@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-9457,1098-1098,,INT J IMAG SYST TECH,Int.

The identification of potholes in this work is using on 2 methods which are spectral clustering (sc) and deep learning methods .In one approach, sc and morphological procedures are employed to process the input picture and then the road pothole is identified by making use of a threshold classifier. For spotting road potholes, this method will not require any training. Making use of cnn and alexnet is the other method for identifying road potholes. To test both strategies a balanced and proportional dataset of Three hundred non-pothole and pothole photographs was used.

The DCNN is used to deal with sensor and actuator faults of robot joints, such as gain error, offset error, and malfunction for both sensors and actuators, and different fault types are diagnosed using the trained neural network. In order to achieve the above goal, the fused data of sensors and actuators are used, where both types of fault are described in one formulation. Then, the deep convolutional neural network is applied to learn characteristic features from the merged data to try to find discriminative information for each kind of fault. After that, the fully connected layer does prediction work based on learned features. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed deep convolutional neural network model, different fault diagnosis methods including support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), conventional neural network (CNN) using the LeNet-5 method, and long-term memory network (LTMN) are investigated and compared with DCNN method.

Chart recognition consists on identifying the chart type and decoding its visual contents into computer understandable values. Previous work in chart image identification has relied on hand crafted features which often fails when dealing with a large amount of data that could contain significant varieties and less common char types.

While most existing studies, such as those in the field of computer vision, have detected object type from the perspective of sensors, this study developed a specialized strategy for object classification using LiDAR data points on the surface of the object. We propose a method for generating a spherically stratified point projection (sP(2)) feature image that can be applied to existing image-classification networks by performing pointwise classification based on a 3D point cloud using only LiDAR sensors data. The sP(2)'s main engine performs image generation through spherical stratification, evidence collection, and channel integration. Spherical stratification categorizes neighboring points into three layers according to distance ranges. Evidence collection calculates the occupancy probability based on Bayes' rule to project 3D points onto a two-dimensional surface corresponding to each stratified layer. Channel integration generates sP(2) RGB images with three evidence values representing short, medium, and long distances. Finally, the sP(2) images are used as a trainable source for classifying the points into predefined semantic labels.

Our results show the benefits of task graphs in terms of better memory use (23.4 % less) over conventional layer-by-layer processing in a simulated environment with the first three layers of LeNet-5. Certain task-graphs trade-off makespan (10% increase) for memory use (20 % decrease).

Previous fault-tolerant methods cannot effectively handle cycle-to-cycle variation (CCV). Many of them also use a pair of positive-weight and negative-weight crossbars to store a weight matrix, which implicitly enhances the fault tolerance but doubles the hardware cost. This paper proposes a novel solution that dramatically reduces the NN accuracy loss under CCV, while still using a single crossbar to store a weight matrix. The key idea is to introduce digital offsets into the crossbar, which further enables two techniques to conquer CCV. The first is a variation-aware weight optimization method that determines the optimal target weights to be written into the crossbar; the second is a post-writing tuning method that optimally sets the digital offsets to recover the accuracy loss due to variation. Simulation results show that the accuracy maintains the ideal value for LeNet with MNIST and only drops by 2.77% over the ideal value for ResNet-18 with CIFAR-10 under a large resistance variation. Moreover, compared to state-of-the-art fault-tolerant methods, our method achieves a better NN accuracy with at least 50% fewer crossbars.","[Meng, Ziqi; Oian, Weikanu; Yang, Rui] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Univ Michigan Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ Joint Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yilonz; Sun, Yanan; Jiang, Li] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Oian, Weikanu; Jiang, Li] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, MoE Key Lab Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Oian, Weikanu] Fudan Univ, State Key Lab ASIC & Syst, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,"Oian, WKN (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Univ Michigan Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ Joint Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Sun, YA; Jiang, L (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Oian, WKN; Jiang, L (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, MoE Key Lab Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Oian, WKN (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, State Key Lab ASIC & Syst, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",qianwk@sjtu.edu.cn; sunyanan@sjtu.edu.cn; ljiang_cs@sjtu.edu.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2020YFB2205501, 2018YFB1403400]; State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System Open Research Grant [2019KF004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61834006]; Shanghai Science and Technology Committee [18ZR1421400]; Shanghai Sailing Program Award [19YF1424900]; SJTU Major Frontier Program [2019QYA01]; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.","National Key R&D Program of China; State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System Open Research Grant; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Science and Technology Committee(Shanghai Science & Technology Committee); Shanghai Sailing Program Award; SJTU Major Frontier Program; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.(Huawei Technologies)","` This work is supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grants 2020YFB2205501 and 2018YFB1403400, the State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System Open Research Grant 2019KF004, National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant 61834006, Shanghai Science and Technology Committee Grant 18ZR1421400, Shanghai Sailing Program Award 19YF1424900, SJTU Major Frontier Program Grant 2019QYA01, and a grant from Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.",,19,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-3-9819263-5-4,,,,2021.0,,,,,,,1078,1083,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BT1YH,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000805289900201,0

The proposed architecture aims to identify the characters and contextualize them with their neighbors to recognize any given word. Our model proposes a novel way to extract relevant visual features from a word image. It combines the use of a horizontal sliding window, to extract image patches, and the application of the LeNet-5 convolutional architecture to identify the characters. Extracted features are modeled using a sequence-to-sequence architecture to encode the visual characteristics and then to decode the sequence of characters in the handwritten text image. We test the proposed model on two handwritten databases (IAM and RIMES) under several experiments to determine the optimal parameterization of the model. Competitive results above those presented in the current state-of-the-art, on handwriting models, are achieved.

The growing popularity of edge computing makes us look for ways to reduce its time for mobile and embedded devices. One way to decrease the neural network inference time is to modify a neuron model to make it more efficient for computations on a specific device. The example of such a model is a bipolar morphological neuron model. The bipolar morphological neuron is based on the idea of replacing multiplication with addition and maximum operations. This model has been demonstrated for simple image classification with LeNet-like architectures In In the paper, we introduce a bipolar morphological ResNet (BM-ResNet) model obtained from a much more complex ResNet architecture by converting its layers to bipolar morphological ones. We apply BM-ResNet to image classification on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with only a moderate accuracy decrease from 99.3% to 99.1% and from 85.3% to 85.1 %. We also estimate the computational complexity of the resulting model.

As such, several works pursue model compression that seeks to drastically reduce computational memory footprints, FLOPS and memory for storage. Many of these works achieve unstructured compression, where the compressed models are not directly useful since dedicated hardware and specialized algorithms are required for storage of sparse weights and fast sparse matrix-vector multiplication respectively. In this paper, we propose structured compression of large DNNs using debiased elastic group LASSO (DEGL), which is motivated by different interesting characteristics of the individual components. That is, where group LASSO penalty enforces structured sparsity, l2-norm penalty promotes features grouping, and debiasing disentangles sparsity and shrinkage effects of group LASSO. We perform extensive experiments by applying DEGL to different DNN architectures including LeNet, VGG, AlexNet and ResNet on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our proposal on domain adaptation using Oxford-102 flower species and Food-5K datasets. Results show that DEGL can compress DNNs by several folds with small or no loss of performance. Particularly, DEGL outperforms conventional group LASSO and several other state-of-the-art methods that perform structured compression.","[Oyedotun, Oyebade K.; Aouada, Djamila; Ottersten, Bjoern] Univ Luxembourg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Secur Reliabil & Trust SnT, L-1855 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Oyedotun, OK (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Secur Reliabil & Trust SnT, L-1855 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",oyebade.oyedotun@uni.lu; djamila.aouada@uni.lu; bjorn.ottersten@uni.lu,,"Aouada, Djamila/0000-0002-7576-2064; Oyedotun, Oyebade/0000-0002-4652-1691","National Research Fund (FNR), Luxembourg [R-AGR-0424-05-D, CPPP17/IS/11643091/IDform]; NVIDIA Corporation","National Research Fund (FNR), Luxembourg(Luxembourg National Research Fund); NVIDIA Corporation","This work was funded by the National Research Fund (FNR), Luxembourg, under the project reference R-AGR-0424-05-D/Bjorn Ottersten and and CPPP17/IS/11643091/IDform/Aouada.

The NoC-based designs can reduce the off-chip memory accesses through a flexible interconnect that facilitates data exchange between processing elements on the chip. We first comprehensively investigate conventional platforms and methodologies used in DNN computing. Then we study and analyze different design parameters to implement the NoC-based DNN accelerator. The presented accelerator is based on mesh topology, neuron clustering, random mapping, and XY-routing. The experimental results on LeNet, MobileNet, and VGG-16 models show the benefits of the NoC-based DNN accelerator in reducing off-chip memory accesses and improving runtime computational flexibility.","[Chen, Kun-Chih (Jimmy); Wang, Ting-Yi; Yang, Yuch-Chi] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Ebrahimi, Masoumeh] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden",,"Chen, KC (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",kcchen@mail.cse.nsysu.edu.tw; mebr@kth.se,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, TAIWAN [MOST 108-2218-E-110-010, MOST 108-2218-E-110-006]; STINT project, SWEDEN; VR project, SWEDEN","Ministry of Science and Technology, TAIWAN(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); STINT project, SWEDEN; VR project, SWEDEN","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology under the grant MOST 108-2218-E-110-010 and MOST 108-2218-E-110-006, TAIWAN; the STINT and VR projects, SWEDEN.",,52,22,22,1,6,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-6700-4,,,,2019.0,,,,,,,,,11,10.1145/3313231.3352376,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BO7XS,,Green Published,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000526028700011,0

Nevertheless, finding defective components is a hard task because they are normally hidden by dusty, which poses hard problems for the image segmentation algorithms. To approach this problem, manual inspection by humans is normally used, but it is time consuming, expensive and sometimes dangerous. Meanwhile, automatic approaches that uses machine learning algorithms are also difficult because the datasets are strongly unbalanced. Such datasets usually induce biased classification models that identify new instances as members of the class with the greatest abundance of examples in the training data. In this paper, we propose a new method that combines the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with imbalanced learning to address the challenge of using machine learning to identify defective components. Our method was tested with real-world data from images used for wagon component inspection. Moreover, we compared our method with an ensemble of MLP networks using features extraction, such as the LeNet, and a CNN network without ensemble learning. Results indicate that our proposed method produced the higher overall accuracy compared to the other methods.","[Fernandes, Everlandio; Rocha, Rafael L.; Carvalho, Schubert] Inst Tecnol Vale, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Ferreira, Bruno; Carvalho, Eduardo; Siravenha, Ana Carolina; Gomes, Ana Claudia S.] SENAI Innovat Inst Mineral Technol, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Carvalho, Eduardo; Siravenha, Ana Carolina] SESI, Reg Dept Para, Social Serv Ind, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Fernandes, Everlandio] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Math & Comp Sci, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Souza, Cleidson R.

Traditional algorithms are not effective in real-time facial expression recognition. This paper is based on the recognition and detection method of convolutional neural network algorithm. Consider applying convolutional neural networks to facial expression recognition and detection. Although there are many existing convolutional network models, none of them is suitable for the recognition of images in various fields. The recognition of facial expressions requires the creation of a network model suitable for expression recognition. This article is based on the LeNet-5 network and the network structure and the internal structure has been optimized and improved. Add batch normalization to solve the problem of network model over fitting caused by different features.

However, existing monitoring models have to face model generalization capacity or other problems, which significantly hampers their further application. Principal component analysis network (PCANet) is a promising interpretable deep learning model, and has been applied in image recognition. Nevertheless, the architecture still needs optimizing. In this paper, a novel multi-scale stacked sparse principal component analysis network (MS-SSPCANet) is proposed to predict tool wear. At first, time-frequency images are generated by short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Then, sparsity, multi-scale filters and multi-scale pooling layer are introduced to optimize PCANet structure. A hybrid pooling layer named GA-SPP, combining global averaging and spatial pyramid pooling layers, is applied to select features. And the selected ones from different filter scales are fused. Finally, support vector regression (SVR) is trained for tool wear prediction. Two milling experiments are conducted, and the vibration signal and corresponding tool wear data are acquired simultaneously. The following performance comparison experiments illustrate the better prediction capacity of the proposed model. Additionally, sparsity and two multi-scale operation (convoluting and pooling) are proven effective, and MS-SSPCANet also outperforms LeNet even after adding -6 dB noise.","[Duan, Jian; Hu, Cheng; Zhan, Xiaobin; Liao, Guanglan; Shi, Tielin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Hongdi] Hubei Univ Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Wuhan 430068, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Duan, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",tlshi@hust.edu.cn,,"Duan, Jian/0000-0003-2493-9453; Zhou, Hongdi/0000-0002-6618-3984",Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province [2020B090927002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [52005168]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2019kfyXJJS079],Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was funded by the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2020B090927002) , National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52005168) , and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 2019kfyXJJS079) .",,52,1,1,25,25,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0736-5845,1879-2537,,ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF,Robot.

But in an edge computing enviroment where the wireless network resource is constrained, the key problem of federated learning is the communication overhead for parameters synchronization, which wastes bandwidth, increases training time, and even impacts the model accuracy. Gradient sparsification has received increasing attention, which only updates significant gradients and accumulates insignificant gradients locally. However, how to preserve the accuracy after a high ratio sparsification has always been ignored. In this paper, a General Gradient Sparsification (GGS) framework is proposed for adaptive optimizers, to correct the sparse gradient update process. It consists of two important mechanisms: gradient correction and batch normalization update with local gradients (BN-LG). With gradient correction, the optimizer can properly treat the accumulated insignificant gradients, which makes the model converge better. Furthermore, updating the batch normalization layer with local gradients can relieve the impact of delayed gradients without increasing the communication overhead. We have conducted experiments on LeNet-5, CifarNet, DenseNet-121, and AlexNet with adaptive optimizers. Results show that when 99.9% gradients are sparsified, validation datasets are maintained with top-1 accuracy.","[Li, Shiqi; Qi, Qi; Wang, Jingyu; Sun, Haifeng; Li, Yujian] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yu, F.

In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly deployed in autonomous driving applications to fulfil complex tasks such as object recognition and image classification. Ensuring the reliability of CNNs is thus becoming an urgent requirement since they constantly behave in human environments. A common and recent trend is to replace the full-precision CNNs to make way for more optimized models exploiting approximation paradigms such as reduced bit-width data type. If from one hand this is poised to become a sound solution for reducing the memory footprint as well as the computing requirements, it may negatively affect the CNNs resilience. The intent of this work is to assess the reliability of a CNN-based system when reduced bit-widths are used for the network parameters (i.e., synaptic weights). The approach evaluates the impact of permanent faults in CNNs by adopting several bit-width schemes and data types, i.e., floating-point and fixed-point. This determines the trade-off between the CNN accuracy and the bits required to represent network weights. The characterization is performed through a fault injection environment built on the darknet open source framework.

Conventional deep learning, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based target detection methods process each signal sample independently, and the temporal-spatial domain correlation information is seldom used. To achieve full utilization of information contained in radar signals and improve the detection performance, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is considered, which has shown great advantages in graph data processing and has been applied in the field of signal processing. This letter proposed a maritime target detection method based on radar signal graph data and graph convolution. Graph structure data is applied to define the detection units and to represent the temporal and spatial information of detection units. The target detection of the signal corresponding to the nodes is conducted via GCN. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect marine targets when the signal-to-noise ratio is above -5 dB and can effectively suppress false alarms in the pure clutter area, which is not adjacent to targets. Compared with the popular used CNN method, e.g., LeNet, the proposed method can achieve higher detection probability with the same given false alarm rate.","[Su, Ningyuan; Chen, Xiaolong; Guan, Jian; Huang, Yong] Naval Aviat Univ, Radar Target Detect Res Grp, Yantai 264001, Peoples R China",,"Chen, XL; Guan, J (corresponding author), Naval Aviat Univ, Radar Target Detect Res Grp, Yantai 264001, Peoples R China.",cxlcxl1209@163.com; guanjian_68@163.com,,,"Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation [ZR2021YQ43]; National Nature Science Foundation of China [61871391, 61931021]",Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported in part by Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation under Grant ZR2021YQ43, and in part by the National Nature Science Foundation of China under Grant 61871391 and Grant 61931021.",,11,1,1,23,31,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1545-598X,1558-0571,,IEEE GEOSCI REMOTE S,IEEE Geosci.

But, in the Internet of Things (IoT) where the wireless network resource is constrained, the key problem of federated learning is the communication overhead for parameter synchronization, which wastes bandwidth, increases training time, and even impacts the model accuracy. Gradient sparsification has received increasing attention, which only updates significant gradients and accumulates insignificant gradients locally. However, how to preserve the accuracy after a high ratio sparsification has been ignored in the literature. In this article, a general gradient sparsification (GGS) framework is proposed for adaptive optimizers, to correct the sparse gradient update process. It consists of two important mechanisms: 1) gradient correction and 2) batch normalization (BN) update with local gradients. With gradient correction, the optimizer can properly treat the accumulated insignificant gradients, which makes the model converge better. Furthermore, updating the BN layer with local gradients can relieve the impact of delayed gradients without increasing the communication overhead. We have conducted experiments on LeNet-5, CifarNet, DenseNet-121, and AlexNet with adaptive optimizers. Results show that when 99.9% gradients are sparsified, validation data sets are maintained with top-1 accuracy.","[Sun, Haifeng; Li, Shiqi; Qi, Qi; Wang, Jingyu; Liao, Jianxin] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China; [Sun, Haifeng; Li, Shiqi; Qi, Qi; Wang, Jingyu; Liao, Jianxin] EBUPT COM, Res Dept, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Yu, F.

However, most of these existing accelerators are designed with the same concept as their ASIC counterparts, that is all operations from different CNN layers are mapped to the same hardware units and work in a multiplexed way. Although this approach improves the generality of these accelerators, it does not take full advantage of reconfigurability and customizability of FPGAs, resulting in a certain degree of computational efficiency degradation, which is even worse on the embedded platforms. In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based CNN accelerator with all the layers mapped to their own on-chip units, and working concurrently as a pipeline. A strategy which can find the optimized paralleling scheme for each layer is proposed to eliminate the pipeline stall and achieve high resource utilization. In addition, a balanced pruning-based method is applied on fully connected (FC) layers to reduce the computational redundancy. As a case study, we implement a widely used CNNs model, LeNet-5, on an embedded FPGA device, Xilinx Zedboard.

However, risks also exist in the evacuation processes. Evaluating the risk of evacuation processes can be used for improving the safety of the evacuation processes and providing additional support for evacuation decision-making, which has important practical significance. At present, because of the complexity of evacuation processes and the lack of data, the research on evacuation risk assessment is still limited. Traditional risk assessment methods have more subjective and are difficult to fulfill the requirements of timeliness in emergency evacuations. With the development of artificial intelligence, it has provided a possibility to use deep learning methods to excavate the internal relationship of complex evacuation systems and achieve rapid risk assessments. This article innovatively applies deep learning methods to the field of risk assessment of evacuation. An approach based on the convolutional neural network is proposed in this article to establish an evacuation assessment model. Two network structures, Lenet and Resnet, are selected to train the model, respectively. A real case of the large stadium is used to illustrate the assessment way, and a large number of experiments were carried out to obtain the data required for training.

Under the coordination of the FL server, each client conducts model training using its own computing resource and private data set. The global model can be created by aggregating the training results of clients. To cope with highly non-IID data distributions, personalized federated learning (PFL) has been proposed to improve overall performance by allowing each client to learn a personalized model. However, one major drawback of a personalized model is the loss of generalization. To achieve model personalization while maintaining better generalization, in this paper, we propose a new approach, named PFL-MoE, which mixes outputs of the personalized model and global model via the MoE architecture. PFL-MoE is a generic approach and can be instantiated by integrating existing PFL algorithms. Particularly, we propose the PFL-MF algorithm which is an instance of PFL-MoE based on the freeze-base PFL algorithm. We further improve PFL-MF by enhancing the decision-making ability of MoE gating network and propose a variant algorithm PFL-MFE.

Because of the soft-field nature and the ill-posed problem in solving inverse problem, traditional image reconstruction methods cannot achieve high accuracy and the process is usually time consuming. Since deep learning is good at mapping complicated nonlinear function, a deep learning method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for image reconstruction of ERT. To establish the database, 41122 samples were generated with numerical simulations. 10-fold cross validation was used to divide all samples into training set and validation set. The network structure was based on LeNet, and refined by applying dropout layer and moving average. After 346 training epochs, the image correlation coefficient (ICC) on validation set was 0.95. When white Gaussian noise with a signal-to-noise ratio of 30, 40, and 50 were added to validation set, the ICC was 0.79, 0.89, and 0.93, respectively, which proved the anti-noise capability of the network. The reconstruction results on samples which have more inclusions, different conductivity, and other shapes explained the network has good generalization ability. Furthermore, experimental data from a 16-electrode industrial ERT system was used to compare the accuracy of the proposed model with some typical reconstruction methods. Results show that the proposed CNN method has better reconstruction results than LBP, Tikhonov, and Landweber.","[Tan, Chao; Lv, Shuhua; Dong, Feng] Tianjin Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Proc Measurement & Control, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Takei, Masahiro] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Chiba 2638522, Japan",,"Tan, C (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Proc Measurement & Control, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",tanchao@tju.edu.cn,"Tan, Chao/F-5858-2013; Dong, Feng/H-6420-2011","Tan, Chao/0000-0001-5146-4807; Dong, Feng/0000-0002-8478-8928; TAKEI, Masahiro/0000-0003-3855-7202",National Natural Science Foundation of China; Royal Society of Edinburgh [61611130126]; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin [17JCZDJC38400],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Royal Society of Edinburgh; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin(Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin),"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61571321, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Royal Society of Edinburgh under Grant 61611130126, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin under Grant 17JCZDJC38400.",,34,109,113,11,97,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1530-437X,1558-1748,,IEEE SENS J,IEEE Sens.

First, the region of interest of the video frame image was sketched and grey-scale processing was performed; sub-pixel-level skeleton images were generated based on the Canny edge detection results of the region of interest; then, the image skeletons were decomposed and reconstructed. Second, a combination of morphological operations and connected domain morphological features were applied for vehicle target recognition, and a deep learning image benchmark library containing 244,520 UAV video vehicle samples was constructed. Third, we improved the AlexNet model by adding convolutional layers, pooling layers, and adjusting network parameters, which we named AlexNet*. Finally, a vehicle recognition method was established based on a candidate target extraction algorithm with AlexNet*. The validation analysis revealed that AlexNet* achieved a mean F-1 of 85.51% for image classification, outperforming AlexNet (82.54%), LeNet (63.88%), CaffeNet (46.64%), VGG16 (16.67%), and GoogLeNet (14.38%).

While the first three can be called visual elements, layout design is the functional arrangement of visual elements. Layout design is as much about making the viewer receive visual information as it is about making them feel attractive. The combination of artificial intelligence and layout design has now become a popular direction in the field of visual communication design. However, the automatic layout design process achieved through an a priori design framework still requires human involvement and is a semi-intelligent application. To solve the above problems, this study proposes a poster layout design method based on artificial intelligence. The layout composition method consists of a learner and a generator. Firstly, the learner uses the spatial transformation network to learn the classification of layout composition elements and form the initial layout design templates for different composition cases. Secondly, the generator optimises the initial template based on the LeNet architecture using the golden ratio and trilateration parameters to produce multiple optimised templates. The templates are then stored in a library of corresponding templates according to their composition and framing style. The experimental results show that the proposed poster layout composition method achieves a higher accuracy rate than existing methods.","[Huo, Huiyu; Wang, Feng] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Design, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huo, Huiyu] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Media & Art, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Huo, HY (corresponding author), Jiangnan Univ, Sch Design, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Huo, HY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Media & Art, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",7180306001@stu.jiangnan.edu.cn; wangfeng@jiangnan.edu.cn,,,,,,,34,0,0,6,6,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1058-9244,1875-919X,,SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH,Sci.

Most existing methods measure the importance of channels with manually designed algorithms and pruning unimportant channels rely on heuristics or expertise during the processing, which are labourious and subjective. In this paper, we proposed a Variational Automatic Channel Pruning Algorithm based on structure optimization (VA-CPSO) which can automatically optimize channel numbers via channel scales in end-to-end manner through variational inference. Firstly, a weights generator controlled by channel scales is built to produce weights for various pruned structure of CNN. And then, the channel scales with truncated factorized log-uniform prior and log-normal posterior are optimized by variational inference for optimal pruning structure. Meanwhile, parameters of the weights generator are optimized synchronously. Finally, the acquired optimal structure and corresponding generated weights are deployed in the pruned CNN for further training to achieve high-performance compression. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed VA-CPSO acquires better compression performance compared to existing pruning algorithms. The VA-CPSO achieve a compression of 34.60x, 4.28x, 1.96x and a speedup of 28.20x, 2.03x, 2.02x on LeNet-5, VGGNet, and ResNet-110 with no more than 0.5% loss of accuracy.","[Han, Shuo; Liu, Xingang] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Yufei] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Glasgow Coll, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",,"Liu, XG (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",h_shuo0108@163.com; unayufei99@163.com; hanksliu@uestc.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Project [2018YFB17002402]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61872404]; Aplied Basic Research Key Programs of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province [2018JY0023],National Key Research and Development Project; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Aplied Basic Research Key Programs of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province,"This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Project under grant 2018YFB17002402, and also partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant 61872404 and the Aplied Basic Research Key Programs of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province on the grant 2018JY0023.",,46,0,1,3,10,"LIBRARY & INFORMATION CENTER, NAT DONG HWA UNIV",HUALIEN,"LIBRARY & INFORMATION CENTER, NAT DONG HWA UNIV, HUALIEN, 00000, TAIWAN",1607-9264,2079-4029,,J INTERNET TECHNOL,J.

Prior works focus on either availability attacks (i.e., lowering the overall model accuracy) or integrity attacks (i.e., enabling specific instance based backdoor). In this paper, we advance the adversarial objectives of the availability attacks to a per-class basis, which we refer to as class-oriented poisoning attacks. We demonstrate that the proposed attack is capable of forcing the corrupted model to predict in two specific ways: (i) classify unseen new images to a targeted supplanter class, and (ii) misclassify images from a victim class while maintaining the classification accuracy on other non-victim classes. To maximize the adversarial effect as well as reduce the computational complexity of poisoned data generation, we propose a gradient-based framework that crafts poisoning images with carefully manipulated feature information for each scenario. Using newly defined metrics at the class level, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed class-oriented poisoning attacks on various models (e.g., LeNet-5, Vgg-9, and ResNet-50) over a wide range of datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-ILSVRC2012) in an end-to-end training setting.","[Zhao, Bingyin; Lao, Yingjie] Clemson Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",,"Zhao, BY (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",bingyiz@clemson.edu; ylao@clemson.edu,,,National Science Foundation [2047384],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation award 2047384.,,47,0,0,0,0,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",2472-6737,,978-1-6654-0915-5,IEEE WINT CONF APPL,,,2022.0,,,,,,,2244,2253,,10.1109/WACV51458.2022.00230,0.0,,,10,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BT1RS,,Green Submitted,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000800471202031,0

Even though a lot of activities are happening in the field, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on analyzing the impact of RDMA-capable networks and CPUs/GPUs on DLoBD stacks. To fill this gap, we propose a systematical characterization methodology and conduct extensive performance evaluations on four representative DLoBD stacks (i.e., CaffeOnSpark, TensorFlowOnSpark, MMLSpark/CNTKOnSpark, and BigDL) to expose the interesting trends regarding performance, scalability, accuracy, and resource utilization. Our observations show that RDMA-based design for DLoBD stacks can achieve up to 2.7x speedup compared to the IPoIB-based scheme. The RDMA scheme also scales better and utilizes resources more efficiently than IPoIB. For most cases, GPU-based schemes can outperform CPU-based designs, but we see that for LeNet on MNIST, CPU + MKL can achieve better performance than GPU and GPU + cuDNN on 16 nodes. Through our evaluation and an in-depth analysis on TensorFlowOnSpark, we find that there are large rooms to improve the designs of current-generation DLoBD stacks.","[Lu, Xiaoyi; Shi, Haiyang; Biswas, Rajarshi; Javed, M.

Previous work showed that simple continuous-valued deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be converted into accurate spiking equivalents. These networks did not include certain common operations such as max-pooling, softmax, batch-normalization and Inception-modules. This paper presents spiking equivalents of these operations therefore allowing conversion of nearly arbitrary CNN architectures. We show conversion of popular CNN architectures, including VGG-16 and lnception-v3, into SNNs that produce the best results reported to date on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and the challenging ImageNet dataset. SNNs can trade off classification error rate against the number of available operations whereas deep continuous-valued neural networks require a fixed number of operations to achieve their classification error rate. From the examples of LeNet for MNIST and BinaryNet for CIFAR-10, we show that with an increase in error rate of a few percentage points, the SNNs can achieve more than 2x reductions in operations compared to the original CNNs. This highlights the potential of SNNs in particular when deployed on power-efficient neuromorphic spiking neuron chips, for use in embedded applications.","[Rueckauer, Bodo; Lungu, Iulia-Alexandra; Hu, Yuhuang; Pfeiffer, Michael; Liu, Shih-Chii] Univ Zurich, Inst Neuroinformat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rueckauer, Bodo; Lungu, Iulia-Alexandra; Hu, Yuhuang; Pfeiffer, Michael; Liu, Shih-Chii] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Pfeiffer, Michael] Bosch Ctr Artificial Intelligence, Renningen, Germany",,"Rueckauer, B (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Neuroinformat, Zurich, Switzerland.;Rueckauer, B (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",rbodo@ini.uzh.ch,,"Rueckauer, Bodo/0000-0003-1628-707X",Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology; ETH Zurich; University of Zurich,Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology(Samsung); ETH Zurich(ETH Zurich); University of Zurich,"This work has been supported by the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich.",,47,286,295,9,39,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1662-453X,,FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ,Front.

Although endoscopy has addressed this limitation to an extent, endovascular procedures such as angioplasty or stenting still face significant challenges. Sensors that rely on a clear line of sight cannot be used because it is unable to gather feedback in blood environments. During the stent deployment procedure, feedback on the deployed stent's state is critical because a partially open stent can affect the blood flow. Despite this, no robust and noninvasive clinical solutions that allow real-time monitoring of the stent deployment exists. In recent years, radio frequency (RF)-based sensors can detect the shape and material of an object that is hidden from the direct line of sight. Herein, the use of a 3D RF-based imaging sensor and a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called StentNet is proposed for detecting the stent's state without a need for a clear line of sight. The StentNet achieves an overall accuracy of 90% in detecting the state of an occluded stent in the test dataset.

To tackle these issues, we propose a sparse learning method to train the existing network on new classes by selecting non-crucial parameters from the network. Sparse learning also manages to keep the performance of existing classes with no additional network structure and memory costs by employing an effective node selection technique, which analyzes and selects unimportant parameters by using information theory in the neuron distribution of the fully connected layers.

Existing compression techniques often generate DNNs that are sensitive to external errors. Because embedded devices may be affected by external lights and outside weather, DNNs running on those devices must be robust to such errors. For robust quantization of DNNs, we formulate an optimization problem that finds the bit width for each layer minimizing the robustness loss. To efficiently find the solution, we design a dynamic programming based algorithm, called QED. We also propose an incremental algorithm, Q* that quickly finds a reasonably robust quantization and then gradually improves it. We have evaluated QED and Q* with three DNN models (LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG-16) and with Gaussian random errors and realistic errors. For comparison, we also evaluate universal quantization that uses equal bit width for all layers and Deep Compression, a weight-sharing based compression technique. When tested with increasing size of errors, QED most robustly gives correct inference output. Even if a DNN is optimized for robustness, its quantizations may not be robust unless QED is used. Moreover, we evaluate Q* for its trade off in execution time and robustness. In one tenth of QED's execution time, Q* gives a quantization 98% as robust as the one by QED.","[Kim, Youngseok; Lee, Junyeol; Kim, Younghoon; Seo, Jiwon] Hanyang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",,"Seo, J (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",com9009@hanyang.ac.kr; shie007@hanyang.ac.kr; nongaussian@hanyang.ac.kr; seojiwon@hanyang.ac.kr,,,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2018R1D1A1A020 86132]; Institute of Information Communications Technology Planning Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT) [2013-0-00109]; Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT [NRF-2016M3C4A7952635]; Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [2017M3C4A7063570]","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Education (MOE), Republic of KoreaNational Research Council for Economics, Humanities & Social Sciences, Republic of Korea); Institute of Information Communications Technology Planning Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT)(Institute for Information & Communication Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP), Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea); Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)","This work is supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2018R1D1A1A020 86132), by Institute of Information Communications Technology Planning Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No.2013-0-00109, WiseKB: Big data based self-evolving knowledge base and reasoning platform), by Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT (NRF-2016M3C4A7952635), and by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (2017M3C4A7063570).

It can be used for protection against unforeseen emergencies in manufacturing system. Recently, fault diagnosis (FD) methods based on deep learning (DL) have become a research hotspot for their excellent performance. However, the training process of deep learning (DL) models is time-consuming because of their high computation complexity. Moreover, most of DL-based FD methods have an assumption the distribution of training datasets in the source domain is the same as that of test datasets in the target domain. However, it is impossible in typical real-world manufacturing applications. In order to cope with these two problems, this paper proposes a FD method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning (TL). Firstly, a CNN model based on LeNet-5 is designed to extract fault features from images which is converted from raw signal data by continuous wavelet transform (CWT), then the performance of the CNN model are improved by fine-tuning which is an effective way of TL. The proposed method is conducted on two well-known datasets and the experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency performance a lot compared with the standard CNN model.","[Liu, Qing; Huang, Chenxi] Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat, Xiamen 36100, Peoples R China",,"Huang, CX (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat, Xiamen 36100, Peoples R China.",tongchenhuang@126.com,"Liu, Qing/GWC-9222-2022",,,,,,30,14,14,3,14,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019.0,7,,,,,,171423,171430,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956052,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,KF6TW,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000509374200005,0

As a potential replacement of accurate multiplication, SC can dramatically mitigate the problematic power consumption by DNNs. However, current SC-multipliers illustrate an extremely imbalanced accuracy across product space - nearly float-point accuracy for those large products but poor for the small ones, which is discordant to the distribution of products by the sparse matrix in networks. In this paper, we present a heterogeneous SC-multiplier that performs three divergent multiplying strategies, including set-to-0, look-up-table, and low-discrepancy-SC, according to different types of SC-noise to guarantee an universal accuracy in the global product space. In addition, a quantization-involved training method is proposed to seam the precision gap between float-point-number based training and stochastic-number based inference. By this way, networks successively learn the SC-operation characters and exhibit a definitely improvement on network precision. The experiment shows that, for single multiplication, the product noise can be restrained by 36.86% on average, and for multiplication in LeNet-5, the improvement reaches to 51.91%.

In order to improve the efficiency of coal production and the safety of the coal mining process, accurate information is always essential. It is indicated that the sound signal produced during the cutting process of the coal mining shearer contains much cutting pattern identification information. In this paper, the original acoustic signal is first collected through an industrial microphone. To analyze the signal deeply, an adaptive Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) was applied to decompose the sound to several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) to subsequently acquire 1024 Hilbert marginal spectrum points. The 1024 time-frequency nodes were reorganized as a 32 x 32 feature map. Moreover, the LeNet-5 convolutional neural network (CNN), with three convolution layers and two sub-sampling layers, was used as the cutting pattern recognizer.

This has spawned research on developing adversarial input attacks as well as training strategies that make DNNs more robust against these attacks. To this end, we derive in this paper exact analytic expressions for the first and second moments (mean and variance) of a small piecewise linear (PL) network (Affine, ReLU, Affine) subject to general Gaussian input. We experimentally show that these expressions are tight under simple linearizations of deeper PL-DNNs, especially popular architectures in the literature (e.g. LeNet and AlexNet). Extensive experiments on image classification show that these expressions can be used to study the behaviour of the output mean of the logits for each class, the interclass confusion and the pixel-level spatial noise sensitivity of the network.

The algorithm based on the coupled template is able to separate the face regions from similar skin regions correctly and enhance the correct rate of face region detection largely. Moreover, a prior knowledge of standard face region can be embedded into face searching process to locate the face position and then a well-trained convolutional neutral network is used to recognize faces so that the accuracy of face recognition can be improved further. The novel approach has a good adaptability to the image with complex background that results in many large sticky similar skin blocks.

Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are considered to be suitable platforms for CNNs based on their high performance, rapid development, and reconfigurability. Although many studies have proposed methods for implementing high-performance CNN accelerators on FPGAs using optimized data types and algorithm transformations, accelerators can be optimized further by investigating more efficient uses of FPGA resources. In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based CNN accelerator using multiple approximate accumulation units based on a fixed-point data type. We implemented the LeNet-5 CNN architecture, which performs classification of handwritten digits using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The proposed accelerator was implemented, using a high-level synthesis tool on a Xilinx FPGA. The proposed accelerator applies an optimized fixed-point data type and loop parallelization to improve performance. Approximate operation units are implemented using FPGA logic resources instead of high-precision digital signal processing (DSP) blocks, which are inefficient for low-precision data.

Subsequently, edge defect recognition models were established on the basis of LeNet-5, AlexNet, and VggNet-16 by using a convolutional neural network as the core. Through multiple groups of training and recognition experiments, the model's accuracy and recognition time of a single defect image were analyzed and compared with recognition models with different learning rates and sample batches. The experimental results showed that the recognition model based on the AlexNet had a maximum accuracy of 93.5%, and the average recognition time of a single defect image was 0.0035 s, which could meet the industry requirement.

However, convolutional neural network is difficult to deploy on resource constrained devices due to their limited computation power and memory space. Thus, it is necessary to prune the redundant weights and filters rationally and effectively. Considering that the pruned model still exists, redundancy after weight pruning or filter pruning alone, a method of combining weight pruning and filter pruning is proposed. First, filter pruning is performed, which is to remove filters with least importance and using fine-tuning to recover the model's accuracy. Then, all connection weights below a threshold are set to zero. Finally, the pruned model obtained by the first two steps is fine-tuned to recover its predictive accuracy. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective and feasible. Compared with only weight pruning or filter pruning, the mixed pruning can achieve higher compression ratio of the model parameters. For LeNet-5, the proposed approach can achieve a compression rate of 13.01x, with 1% drop in accuracy. For VGG-16, it can achieve a compression rate of 19.20x, incurring 1.56% accuracy loss.","[Yang, Wenzhu; Jin, Lilei; Wang, Sile; Cu, Zhenchao; Chen, Xiangyang; Chen, Liping] Hebei Univ, Sch Cyber Secur & Comp, Baoding, Peoples R China",,"Yang, WZ (corresponding author), Hebei Univ, Sch Cyber Secur & Comp, Baoding, Peoples R China.",wenzhuyang@163.com,,,"National Science Foundation of Hebei Province [F2015201033, F201701069]; Foundation of H3C [2017A20004]",National Science Foundation of Hebei Province; Foundation of H3C,"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of Hebei Province (grant numbers: F2015201033, F201701069), the Foundation of H3C (grant number: 2017A20004).

In this proposed method, the U-Net extended the convolutional neural network (CNN), is adjusted for road extraction from SAR images. To investigate the potential of using the U-Net based fully convolutional neural network (FCN) for road extraction, LeNet-5, is applied as a preliminary DNN model. Additionally, several training optimizations are introduced to improve accuracy. To assess the performance of the different polarization modes used in road extraction, both single-polarimetric and dual-polarimetric data were investigated. Moreover, four machine learning algorithms have been compared for accuracy and speed. As a result, the outcome evaluation of Precision, Recall, and F-1 obtained by FCN is better than the original CNN, and the training time has been significantly reduced.

Ultrasound provides real-time, safe, and cost-effective routine examinations. Deep learning allows the automatic generation of useful features for classification. This study utilized deep learning of ultrasound imaging for classifying patients with DMD based on their ambulatory function. A total of 85 individuals (including ambulatory and nonambulatory subjects) underwent ultrasound examinations of the gastrocnemius for deep learning of image data using LeNet, AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-16(TL), VGG-19, and VGG-19(TL) models (the notation TL indicates fine-tuning pretrained models). Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to visualize features recognized by the models. The classification performance was evaluated using the confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The results show that each deep learning model endows muscle ultrasound imaging with the ability to enable DMD evaluations. The Grad-CAMs indicated that boundary visibility, muscular texture clarity, and posterior shadowing are relevant sonographic features recognized by the models for evaluating ambulatory function. Of the proposed models, VGG-19 provided satisfying classification performance (the area under the ROC curve: 0.98; accuracy: 94.18%) and feature recognition in terms of physical characteristics.

Currently, however, most research efforts on climate forecasting are based on mechanistic, bottom-up approaches such as physics-based general circulation models and earth system models. In this study, we explore the performance of a phenomenological, top-down model constructed using a neural network and big data of global mean monthly temperature. By generating graphical images using the monthly temperature data of 30 years, the neural network system successfully predicts the rise and fall of temperatures for the next 10 years. Using LeNet for the convolutional neural network, the accuracy of the best global model is found to be 97.0%; we found that if more training images are used, a higher accuracy can be attained. We also found that the color scheme of the graphical images affects the performance of the model. Moreover, the prediction accuracy differs among climatic zones and temporal ranges. This study illustrated that the performance of the top-down approach is notably high in comparison to the conventional bottom-up approach for decadal-scale forecasting. We suggest using artificial intelligence-based forecasting methods along with conventional physics-based models because these two approaches can work together in a complementary manner.","[Ise, Takeshi; Oba, Yurika] Kyoto Univ, FSERC, Kyoto, Japan; [Ise, Takeshi] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan",,"Ise, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, FSERC, Kyoto, Japan.;Ise, T (corresponding author), Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, Kawaguchi, Saitama, Japan.",ise@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"JST PRESTO, Japan [JPMJPR15O1]; Link Again Program of the Nippon Foundation-Kyoto University Joint Project","JST PRESTO, Japan; Link Again Program of the Nippon Foundation-Kyoto University Joint Project","This study was supported by JST PRESTO, Japan (Grant No. JPMJPR15O1) and the Link Again Program of the Nippon Foundation-Kyoto University Joint Project.",,16,12,14,0,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-9144,,,FRONT ROBOT AI,Front.

In order to make the machine tool stable for processing, this paper proposes a smart bearing diagnosis system (SBDS), which uses a gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM)-based convolutional neuro-fuzzy network (GC-CNFN) to detect the bearing status of the machine tool. The developed GC-CNFN is composed of a convolutional layer and neuro-fuzzy network. The convolutional layer can automatically extract vibration signal features, which are then classified using the neuro-fuzzy network. Moreover, Grad-CAM is used to analyze the attention of the diagnosis model. To verify the performance of bearing fault classification, the 1D CNN (ODCNN) and improved 1D LeNet-5 (I1DLeNet) were adopted to compare with the proposed GC-CNFN. Experimental results showed that the proposed GC-CNFN required fewer parameters (20K), had a shorter average calculation time (117.7 s), and had a higher prediction accuracy (99.88%) in bearing fault classification. The proposed SBDS can not only accurately classify bearing faults, but also help users understand the current status of the machine tool.","[Lin, Cheng-Jian; Jhang, Jyun-Yu] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Intelligence, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lin, Cheng-Jian] Natl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung 41170, Taiwan",,"Lin, CJ (corresponding author), Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Intelligence, Taichung, Taiwan.;Lin, CJ (corresponding author), Natl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung 41170, Taiwan.",cjlin@ncut.edu.tw; o800920@gmail.com,,"Lin, Cheng-Jian/0000-0002-8709-2715; Jhang, Jyun-Yu/0000-0001-6179-9125","Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China [MOST 109-2218-E-005-002, MOST 110-2634-F-009-024]","Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China, grant number MOST 109-2218-E-005-002 and MOST 110-2634-F-009-024.",,41,1,1,4,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,JUL,2021.0,9,13,,,,,,,1502,10.3390/math9131502,0.0,,,19,Mathematics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics,TF9CA,,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000671010800001,0

Many works so far have focused on CNN connection pruning methods which produce sparse parameter tensors in convolutional or fully-connected layers. It has been demonstrated in several studies that even simple methods can effectively eliminate connections of a CNN. However, since these methods make parameter tensors just sparser but no smaller, the compression may not transfer directly to acceleration without support from specially designed hardware. In this paper, we propose an iterative approach named Auto-balanced Filter Pruning, where we pre-train the network in an innovative auto-balanced way to transfer the representational capacity of its convolutional layers to a fraction of the filters, prune the redundant ones, then re-train it to restore the accuracy. In this way, a smaller version of the original network is learned and the floating-point operations (FLOPs) are reduced. By applying this method on several common CNNs, we show that a large portion of the filters can be discarded without obvious accuracy drop, leading to significant reduction of computational burdens. Concretely, we reduce the inference cost of LeNet-5 on MNIST, VGG-16 and ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10 by 95.1%, 79.7% and 60.9%, respectively.","[Ding, Xiaohan; Ding, Guiguang] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Software, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Han, Jungong] Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England; [Tang, Sheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China",,"Ding, XH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Software, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",dxh17@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; dinggg@tsinghua.edu.cn; jungonghan77@gmail.com; ts@ict.ac.cn,"Han, Jungong/ABE-6812-2020",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61571269]; Royal Society Newton Mobility Grant [IE150997],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Royal Society Newton Mobility Grant,This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61571269) and the Royal Society Newton Mobility Grant (IE150997).

Quantization of model parameters (i.e., weights) and/or activations to alleviate the complexity of these networks while preserving accuracy is a popular powerful technique. Nonetheless, previous studies have shown that quantization level is limited as the accuracy of the network decreases afterward. We propose Residue-Net, a multiplication-free accelerator for neural networks that uses Residue Number System (RNS) to achieve substantial energy reduction. RNS breaks down the operations to several smaller operations that are simpler to implement. Moreover, Residue-Net replaces the copious of costly multiplications with non-complex, energy-efficient shift and add operations to further simplify the computational complexity of neural networks. To evaluate the efficiency of our proposed accelerator, we compared the performance of Residue-Net with a baseline FPGA implementation of four widely-used networks, viz., LeNet, AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-50. When delivering the same performance as the baseline, Residue-Net reduces the area and power (hence energy) respectively by 36% and 23%, on average with no accuracy loss.

In this paper, we propose a new layer for CNNs that increases their robustness to several types of corruptions of the input images. We call it a 'push-pull' layer and compute its response as the combination of two half-wave rectified convolutions, with kernels of different size and opposite polarity. Its implementation is based on a biologically motivated model of certain neurons in the visual system that exhibit response suppression, known as push-pull inhibition. We validate our method by replacing the first convolutional layer of the LeNet, ResNet and DenseNet architectures with our push-pull layer. We train the networks on original training images from the MNIST and CIFAR data sets and test them on images with several corruptions, of different types and severities, that are unseen by the training process.

This work introduces and documents PPML-TSA, a versatile framework for privacy-preserving time series classification. Our framework was initially used to evaluate privacy-preserving methods across different model architectures and datasets. PPML-TSA offers a modular design suitable for performing classification on all datasets from the entire UCR & UEA repository. Its modular implementation offers quick and easy adaptation and extension to increase the number of supported model architectures and datasets.

In addition, high accuracy levels of image detection and recognition cannot be compromised for the need for high throughput. In this paper, we present TileNET, a novel tiled architecture for ternary-weighted CNNs. TileNET is modular and scalable across variations in network organization and device configurations. Two modes of the implementation are presented, viz., systolic and streaming. A high-level estimation technique has been developed that facilitates fast performance evaluation through design space exploration among a range of target devices and varying CNN models. Performance has been verified for area and throughput estimation for Xilinx Virtex, Artix, Kintex and Zynq devices. TileNET implemented on Virtex-7 (XC7VX1140T) results in a throughput of about 16 Teraoperations per second (TOPs) for LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet-50 and VGG-16.

We need a layer that can apply different convolution kernels for different areas of an input image and not carry so many parameters as a locally-connected layer for high scale resolution images. This is why in this paper, we introduce a new type of convolutional layer - a block layer, and a way to construct a neural network using block convolutional layers to achieve better performance in the image classification problem. The influence of block layers on the quality of the neural network classifier is shown in this paper. We also provide a comparison with neural network architecture LeNet-5 as a baseline.

First, based on the principle of binocular photogrammetry, a multi-channel sample construction method of 3D vibration information fusion is proposed. This method can integrate the motion information of multiple measurement points on the surface of the wind turbine blade, gain the acquired signal with more abundant features, and greatly decrease additional weight interference. Secondly, in order to obtain multi-level semantic information of cracks, a new multi-scale convolutional neural network is proposed. A type of 1. 5 kW wind turbine blade was selected to carry out crack diagnosis experiments, and a database of samples of different crack states was established. The prediction accuracy reached 93. 4%, which verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

ARGA provides an approximate lookup table to GPGPU cores to avoid re-computing instructions with identical or similar values. We propose multi-table parallel lookup which enables computational reuse to significantly speed-up GPGPU computation by checking incoming instructions in parallel. The inputs of each operation are searched for in a lookup table. Matches resulting in an exact or low error are removed from the floating point pipeline and used directly as output. Matches producing highly inaccurate results are computed on exact hardware to minimize application error. We simulate our design by placing ARGA within each core of an Nvidia Kepler Architecture Titan and an AMD Southern Island 7970. We show our design improves performance throughput by up to 2.7x and improves EDP by 5.3x for 6 GPGPU applications while maintaining less than 5% output error.

In this article, we propose convolutional neural network (CNN) as a tool to improve efficiency and accuracy of osteosarcoma tumor classification into tumor classes (viable tumor, necrosis) versus nontumor. The proposed CNN architecture contains eight learned layers: three sets of stacked two convolutional layers interspersed with max pooling layers for feature extraction and two fully connected layers with data augmentation strategies to boost performance. The use of a neural network results in higher accuracy of average 92% for the classification. We compare the proposed architecture with three existing and proven CNN architectures for image classification: AlexNet, LeNet, and VGGNet.

However, the speed of dedicated hardware has always exceeded that of data acquisition/loading of software. Therefore, the hardware can stay idle due to a long wait for the software, which will lead to less benefits even when utilizing hardware acceleration. In this paper, a hardware-reusing strategy is proposed based on the structural characteristics of CNNs. Furthermore, a heuristic hardware/software time-balancing flow is introduced with the help of the hardware-reusing to narrow and even eliminate the imbalance of hardware-software time in the low-cost end-to-end embedded CNN inference system. On the premise that the system's time and accuracy requirements are met, the hardware speed is optimized in hardware design to achieve the hardware/software time-balancing. Based on these two strategies, an end-to-end embedded CNN inference system with low hardware cost and hardware/software time-balancing (S-CNN-ESystem) is suggested.

Additionally, preoperative diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma with micropapillary patterns is also critical for clinical decision making. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of deep learning models on classifying invasiveness degree and attempted to predict the micropapillary pattern in lung adenocarcinoma. Methods:The records of 291 histopathologically confirmed lung adenocarcinoma patients were retrospectively analyzed and consisted of 61 adenocarcinomain situ, 80 minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, 117 invasive adenocarcinoma, and 33 invasive adenocarcinoma with micropapillary components (>5%). We constructed two diagnostic models, the Lung-DL model and the Dense model, based on the LeNet and the DenseNet architecture, respectively. Results:For distinguishing the nodule invasiveness degree, the area under the curve (AUC) value of the diagnosis with the Lung-DL model is 0.88 and that with the Dense model is 0.86. In the prediction of the micropapillary pattern, overall accuracies of 92 and 72.91% were obtained for the Lung-DL model and the Dense model, respectively.

At present, model reverse attack is an important means of model confidentiality attacks, but all of these attacks require strong attack ability, meanwhile, the success rates of these attacks are low. We study the time leakage of CNN running on the SoC (system on-chip) system and propose a reverse method based on side-channel attack. It uses the SDK tool-profiler to collect the time leakage of different networks of various CNNs. According to the linear relationship between time leakage, calculation, and memory usage parameters, we take the profiling attack to establish a mapping library of time and the different networks. After that, the smallest difference between the measured time of unknown models and the theoretical time in the mapping library is considered to be the real parameters of the unknown models. Finally, we can reverse other layers even the entire model. Based on the experiments, the reverse success rate of common convolutional layers is above 78.5%, and the reverse success rates of different CNNs (such as AlexNet, ConvNet, LeNet, etc.) are all above 67.67%.

With the dynamically reconfigurable architecture, the data path, the calculation method, the activation function, and the pooling way and size can be modified according to the configurable information for different CNN models. In the computing cores, the global clock is replaced by the local pulse signals from Click elements. An asynchronous pipeline formed by Click elements enables the circuits to work in pipeline mode without any sacrifice of speed because of the self-timed characteristic of asynchronous circuits. Each computing core has a 5x5 registers array that is fully connected by an asynchronous Mesh network, by which the input data can be fully reused. A novel computing pattern called convolution-andpooling-integrated computing, which combines convolution and pooling computing together, is proposed to reduce the access to the intermediate data. These yield an 88% decrease of the access to off-chip memory, which significantly reduces energy consumption. A CNN model, LeNet-5, is implemented in our accelerator with the FPGA of Xilinx VC707.

Second, we present a customizable CMOS/ReRAM hybrid hardware architecture for Spiking CNN. The architecture consists of an array of configurable basic units (CBU), which involves a CMOS adder for neuron operations and a 1T1R memristive crossbar for storing synaptic weights. A column of CBUs can be configured as spiking neurons corresponding to convolutional kernels with various sizes while the whole array can be configured to provide row parallelism for a kernel convolution and inter-kernel parallelism.

This research attempts to fill this gap by utilizing two different convolution neural networks (CNNs) to detect young and mature oil palm separately and uses GIS during data processing and result storage process. The initial architecture developed is based on a CNN called LeNet. The training process reduces loss using adaptive gradient algorithm with a mini batch of size 20 for all the training sets used. Then, we exported prediction results to GIS software and created oil palm prediction map for mature and young oil palm. Based on the proposed method, the overall accuracies for young and mature oil palm are 95.11% and 92.96%, respectively.

Deep learning (DL) based on convolutional neural network (CNN) has the characteristics of automatic feature extraction. In this paper, a target classification method based on CNN is proposed to classify the PMMW images. Better effects are realized by the proposed CNN model which combines the structure of LeNet model and the structure construction idea of VGGNet, with the advantages of uncomplicated structure and few parameters. The problem of low recognition accuracy of PMMW image in fewer samples cases is also solved.

The risk of IVN devices has still been insecure and vulnerable due to the complex data-intensive architectures which greatly increase the accessibility to unauthorized networks and the possibility of various types of cyberattacks. Therefore, the detection of cyberattacks in IVN devices has become a growing interest. With the rapid development of IVNs and evolving threat types, the traditional machine learning-based IDS has to update to cope with the security requirements of the current environment.

This manuscript proposes a deep transfer learning-based IDS model for IVN along with improved performance in comparison to several other existing models. The unique contributions include effective attribute selection which is best suited to identify malicious CAN messages and accurately detect the normal and abnormal activities, designing a deep transfer learning-based LeNet model, and evaluating considering real-world data.

However, training these large networks demands high computational time and energy requirements; hence, their energy-efficient implementation is of great interest. In this work, we reduce the training complexity of CNNs by replacing certain weight kernels of a CNN with Gabor filters. The convolutional layers use the Gabor filters as fixed weight kernels, which extracts intrinsic features, with regular trainable weight kernels. This combination creates a balanced system that gives better training performance in terms of energy and time, compared to the standalone CNN (without any Gabor kernels), in exchange for tolerable accuracy degradation. We show that the accuracy degradation can be mitigated by partially training the Gabor kernels, for a small fraction of the total training cycles. We evaluated the proposed approach on 4 benchmark applications. Simple tasks like face detection and character recognition (MNIST and TiCH), were implemented using LeNet architecture. While a more complex task of objet recognition (CIFAR10) was implemented on a state-ofthe-art deep CNN (Network in Network) architecture. The proposed approach yields 1.31-1.53x improvement in training energy in comparison to conventional CNN implementation. We also obtain improvement up to 1.4x in training time, up to 2.23x in storage requirements, and up to 2.2x in memory access energy.

Here, we propose a method to detect amino acids from a mixture at room temperature and in humid air. A THz-TDS spectrometer scans tablets of amino acid mixtures laid out on a polyethylene plate in transmission mode. The resulting spectroscopic imaging is then converted to probability maps (chemical maps), where the region containing the expected amino acid has higher pixel values, by a matrix manipulation with the matrix of absorption spectra. This approach is substantially resistant to air humidity and scattering caused by uneven grain sizes and is applicable to substances without strong absorption features. A classifier based, on LeNet-5 is built to identify the subsection of the chemical map containing the expected substance, and the prediction reaches 100% accuracy for the testing dataset. The results of the classifier are compared with those of a support vector machine, whose accuracy is much lower due to its inferior ability to recognize complex patterns. The proposed method will enable us to qualitatively detect a component from an unknown mixture in a single measurement and will be useful for bio-molecule detection in real-life scenarios.

The linear transformations, which are generally used in the fully connected as well as convolutional layers, contain most of the variational parameters that are trained and stored. Compressing a deep neural network to reduce its number of variational parameters but not its prediction power is an important but challenging problem toward the establishment of an optimized scheme in training efficiently these parameters and in lowering the risk of overfitting. Here we show that this problem can be effectively solved by representing linear transformations with matrix product operators (MPOs), which is a tensor network originally proposed in physics to characterize the short-range entanglement in one-dimensional quantum states. We have tested this approach in five typical neural networks, including FC2, LeNet-5, VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet on two widely used data sets, namely, MNIST and CIFAR-10, and found that this MPO representation indeed sets up a faithful and efficient mapping between input and output signals, which can keep or even improve the prediction accuracy with a dramatically reduced number of parameters. Our method greatly simplifies the representations in deep learnin, and opens a possible route toward establishing a framework of modern neural networks which might be simpler and cheaper, but more efficient.","[Gao, Ze-Feng; He, Rong-Qiang; Xie, Z.

To avoid high computing resource requirements of such complex networks, and to enable operation on devices with limited resources, this work introduces the concept of adaptive kernels applied to convolutional layers. Motivated by the non-linear perception response in human visual cells, the input image is used to define the weights of a dynamically changing kernel, named adaptive kernel. This novel adaptive kernel is used to perform a second convolution operation over the input image in order to generate the output features. Adaptive kernels enable accurate recognition with significant lower memory requirements; this is accomplished by reducing the number of kernels and the number of layers needed as compared to typical CNN configurations. Additionally, the use of adaptive kernels allow the decrease by 2X the number of epochs required for training, and the number of activation function computations. Our experimental results show a reduction of 66X of the parameters needed of a CNN compared to LeNet when evaluated with the MNIST dataset, maintaining >99% of accuracy. Additionally, when using adaptive kernels implemented in a ResNet18, we observed a higher performance when compared to a known ResNet100 reported in the literature for CIFAR10 and it also gets better accuracy for ImageNet database.","[Zamora-Esquivel, Julio; Cruz Vargas, Adan; Lopez Meyer, Paulo; Tickoo, Omesh] Intel Labs, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",,"Zamora-Esquivel, J (corresponding author), Intel Labs, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",julio.c.zamora.esquivel@intel.com,,,,,,,24,5,5,1,1,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",2473-9936,,978-1-7281-5023-9,IEEE INT CONF COMP V,,,2019.0,,,,,,,1998,2005,,10.1109/ICCVW.2019.00249,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BP4UH,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000554591602011,0

To mitigate these limitations, we present a systematic weight pruning framework of DNNs using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We first formulate the weight pruning problem of DNNs as a nonconvex optimization problem with combinatorial constraints specifying the sparsity requirements, and then adopt the ADMM framework for systematic weight pruning. By using ADMM, the original nonconvex optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems that are solved iteratively. One of these subproblems can be solved using stochastic gradient descent, the other can be solved analytically. Besides, our method achieves a fast convergence rate. The weight pruning results are very promising and consistently outperform the prior work. On the LeNet-5 model for the MNIST data set, we achieve 71.2x weight reduction without accuracy loss. On the AlexNet model for the ImageNet data set, we achieve 21x weight reduction without accuracy loss. When we focus on the convolutional layer pruning for computation reductions, we can reduce the total computation by five times compared with the prior work (achieving a total of 13.4x weight reduction in convolutional layers).

This has several benefits such as speeding up model training, reducing energy consumption, and reducing required storage space. These benefits are especially crucial in settings like federated learning where initial overhead costs are justified by the speedup they enable. Currently, 1) each synthetic sample is assigned a single 'hard' label, and 2) dataset distillation can only be used with image data. We propose to simultaneously distill both images and their labels, thus assigning each synthetic sample a 'soft' label (a distribution of labels). Our algorithm increases accuracy by 2-4% for several image classification tasks. Using 'soft' labels also enables distilled datasets to consist of fewer samples than there are classes as each sample encodes information for multiple classes. For example, training a LeNet model with 10 distilled images (one per class) results in over 96% accuracy on MNIST, and almost 92% accuracy when trained on just 5 distilled images. We also extend the dataset distillation algorithm to distill text data. We demonstrate that text distillation outperforms other methods across multiple datasets. For example, models attain almost their original accuracy on the IMDB sentiment analysis task using just 20 distilled sentences.

This GSD operates in reverse mode, so the synapse current is considerably low, helping to implement a low-power hardware-based neural networks (HNNs). The reverse Schottky diode current, which represents the synaptic weight, is modulated by applying program or erase pulses. In this GSD, the reverse diode current is used as the synapse current, but the forward diode current is cut off. This is an important feature to prevent the sneak path problem in the crossbar array. A synapse array consisting of fabricated 200 GSDs shows a variation (s/mu) of 0.34, 0.22, and 0.14 for three different synaptic weight states.

Normalization method is applied to the weights trained in the network to map the weights into the conductance range of synapse device.

However, typical pattern classifiers are trained using original images. There has been little prior study on how lossily decompressed images would impact the classification performance. In a case study of automatic classification of malaria infected cells, we used decompressed cell images as the inputs to deep convolutional neural networks. We evaluated how various lossy image compression methods and varying compression ratios would impact the classification accuracies. Specifically, we compared four compression methods: lossy compression via bitplane reduction, JPEG and JPEG 2000, and sparse autoencoders. Decompressed images were fed into LeNet-5 for training and testing. Simulation results showed that for similar compression ratios, the bitplane reduction method had the lowest classification accuracy, while JPEG and JPEG 2000 methods could maintain good accuracies. In particular, JPEG 2000 decompressed images could achieve about 95% accuracy even after 30 to 1 compression. We also provide classification results based on the widely used MNIST dataset, where handwritten digits were found to be much easier to classify using decompressed images, with about 90% accuracy still achievable using only one single bitplane. As a lossy compression method, Autoencoder was also applied to the MNIST dataset, achieving about 85% accuracy with a compression ratio much higher than the other three lossy image compression methods.

This paper proposes a reconfigurable neural accelerator (RNA) for flexible and efficient CNN acceleration. To provide hardware flexibility, RNA employs dynamically reconfigurable computing framework to rapidly configure data path between processing elements (PE) at run-time, as well as an interlaced data access mechanism for multi-bank RAM. To achieve high energy efficiency, three optimization mechanisms, including image row broadcasting dataflow (IRBD), tile-by-tile computing (TTC), and zero detection technology (ZDT), are dedicatedly designed for RNA to exploit data reuse and decrease memory bandwidth requirement, which is the key to improving performance and saving power consumption. To save hardware overhead, an online dynamic adaptive data truncation (DADT) mechanism is designed to compensate accuracy loss of multiplication results so that the computational precision in RNA can be reduced from 16-bit to 8-bit, which contributes to reducing the area of data path. The RNA architecture is implemented on Xilinx XC7Z100 FPGA and works at 250 MHz. Experimental results show that the performance of running LeNet, AlexNet and VGG are 500 GOPS, 598 GOPS and 660 GOPS, respectively. Compared to previous FPGA-based designs, RNA achieves 1.5 x -4.3x performance speedup and 7.6 x -8.4x improvements on energy efficiency.","[Yang, Chen; Hou, Jia; Wang, Yizhou; Zhang, Haibo; Wang, Xiaoli; Geng, Li] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Microelect, 28 Xianning West Rd, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Yang, C (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Microelect, 28 Xianning West Rd, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",chyang00@xjtu.edu.cn; hjwst@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; wangyizhou@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; haibozhang@stu.xjtu.ed.cn; xlwang@xjtu.edu.cn; gengli@xjtu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [62176206]; Aeronautical Science Foundation of China [2020Z066070001]; Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province [2019B010154002],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Aeronautical Science Foundation of China; Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 62176206, and in part by the Aeronautical Science Foundation of China under Grant 2020Z066070001, and in part by Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province under Grant 2019B010154002.",,62,0,0,1,1,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0218-1266,1793-6454,,J CIRCUIT SYST COMP,J.

The eye tracker records a large number of eye movements within a short period. Therefore, visualizing raw gaze data with the visual stimulus appears complicated and obscured, making it difficult to gain insight through visualization. To avoid the complication, we often employ fixation identification algorithms for more abstract visualizations. In the past, many scientists have focused on gaze data abstraction with the attention map and analyzed detail gaze movement patterns with the scanpath visualization. Abstract eye movement patterns change dramatically depending on fixation identification algorithms in the preprocessing. However, it is difficult to find out how fixation identification algorithms affect gaze movement pattern visualizations. Additionally, scientists often spend much time on adjusting parameters manually in the fixation identification algorithms. In this paper, we propose a gaze behavior-based data processing method for abstract gaze data visualization. The proposed method classifies raw gaze data using machine learning models for image classification, such as CNN, AlexNet, and LeNet. Additionally, we compare the velocity-based identification (I-VT), dispersion-based identification (I-DT), density-based fixation identification, velocity and dispersion-based (I-VDT), and machine learning based and behavior-based modelson various visualizations at each abstraction level, such as attention map, scanpath, and abstract gaze movement visualization.","[Yoo, Sangbong; Jeong, Seongmin; Jang, Yun] Sejong Univ, Comp Engn & Convergence Engn Intelligent Drone, Seoul 05006, South Korea",,"Jang, Y (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Comp Engn & Convergence Engn Intelligent Drone, Seoul 05006, South Korea.",usangbong@gmail.com; qnqbw@naver.com; jangy@sejong.edu,"Jang, Yun/AAG-5238-2022; Jang, Yun/AFK-6886-2022","Yoo, Sangbong/0000-0002-0973-9288; Jang, Yun/0000-0001-7745-1158","Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation(IITP) - Korea government(MSIT) [2019-0-00242, 2019-0-00795, 2021-0-00469]",Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation(IITP) - Korea government(MSIT),"This work was supported by Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation(IITP) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (No.2019-0-00242, Development of a Big Data Augmented Analysis Profiling Platform for Maximizing Reliability and Utilization of Big Data, No.2019-0-00795, Development of integrated cross-model data processing platform supporting a unified analysis of various big data models, and No.2021-0-00469, Development of heterogeneous fusion data detection and tracking technologies).",,65,0,0,5,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JUL,2021.0,21,14,,,,,,,4686,10.3390/s21144686,0.0,,,21,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,TO7IK,34300425.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000677080100001,0

In this paper, we have constructed automated segmentation models for the retinal vessel segmentation task based on convolutional neural networks. Since some typical deep convolutional neural networks need to be fed by high-resolution patches, small retinal patches should be interpolated to the specific resolution. The interpolated patches sometimes would introduce additional noises. Thus, we modify some typical deep architectures by inserting a set of convolutional layers. In this way, our models have the ability to adapt to different resolutions. Overall, five models are analyzed and compared in our studies including LeNet, M-AlexNet (modified AlexNet), M-ZF-Net (Modified ZF-Net), M-VGG (Modified VGG) and Deformable-ConvNet. Deformable-ConvNet captures the vascular structure and is used to do the retinal vessel segmentation task for the first time.

It applies a convolutional neural network (CNN) to discriminate maize plants from weeds in real time, at early crop development stages. It was applied to maize crop because it is a common staple crop in the Ecuadorian Highlands. The convolutional neural network has been trained with a dataset generated in the segmentation stage. The performance of the network was analyzed with LeNET, AlexNet, cNET and sNET network architectures. The network architecture that presented the best training results was cNET based on its performance in terms of accuracy and processing time.

Secondly, the global information carried by the entire input may be lost in convolution, pooling, or other operations, and these problems will weaken the performance of classification. In order to solve such problems, based on the feature spectrogram from the wavelet transform for the birdsongs, this paper explored the multi-scale convolution neural network (MSCNN) and proposed an ensemble multi-scale convolution neural network (EMSCNN) classification framework. The experiments compared the MSCNN and EMSCNN models with other CNN models including LeNet, VGG16, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB7, Darknet53 and SPP-net.

Firstly, the reflectance spectra of healthy and mildly, moderately and severely FHB-infected wheat kernels were extracted from HSI images, and five effective wavelengths (EWs) of the spectra were selected by random frog. Secondly, the reflectance images (RIs) of different combinations of the EWs were screened using LeNet-5, and a residual attention convolution neural network (RACNN), which was constructed by increasing width and depth and adding channel attention and residual modules, was adopted to recognise various FHB infection degrees in wheat kernels.

Introducing sparsity in the network is a way to reduce those requirements. However, systematically employing pruning under given accuracy requirements is a challenging problem. We propose a novel methodology that iteratively applies a magnitude-based Class-Blind pruning to compress a DNN for obtaining a sparse model. It is a generic methodology and can be applied to different types of DNNs. We demonstrate that retraining after pruning is essential to restore the accuracy of the network. Experimental results show that our methodology is able to reduce the model size by around two orders of magnitude, without noticeably affecting the accuracy. It requires several iterations of pruning and retraining, but can achieve up to 190x Memory Saving Ratio (for the LeNet on the MNIST dataset) when compared to the baseline model. Similar results are also obtained for more complex networks like 91x for VGG-16 on the CIFAR100 dataset. If we combine this work with an efficient coding for sparse networks, like Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) or Compressed Sparse Row (CSR), we can obtain a reduced memory footprint. Our methodology can be complemented by other compression techniques, like weight sharing, quantization or fixed-point conversion, that allows to further reduce memory and computations.","[Marchisio, Alberto; Martina, Maurizio] Polytech Univ Turin, Turin, Italy; [Marchisio, Alberto; Hanif, Muhammad Abdullah; Shafique, Muhammad] Vienna Univ Technol, Vienna, Austria",,"Marchisio, A (corresponding author), Polytech Univ Turin, Turin, Italy.;Marchisio, A (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Technol, Vienna, Austria.",alberto.marchisio@tuwien.ac.at; muhammad.hanif@tuwien.ac.at; maurizio.martina@polito.it; muhammad.shafique@tuwien.ac.at,"Marchisio, Alberto/U-3706-2019","Marchisio, Alberto/0000-0002-0689-4776",,,,,39,2,2,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2161-4393,,978-1-5090-6014-6,IEEE IJCNN,,,2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BQ3NO,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000585967404103,0

The goal of SubFlow is to complete the execution of a DNN task within a timing constraint that may dynamically change while ensuring comparable performance to executing the full network by executing a subset of the DNN at run-time. To this end, we propose two online algorithms that enable SubFlow: 1) dynamic construction of a sub-network which constructs the best sub-network of the DNN in terms of size and configuration, and 2) time-bound execution which executes the sub-network within a given time budget either for inference or training. We implement and open-source SubFlow by extending TensorFlow with full compatibility by adding SubFlow operations for convolutional and fully-connected layers of a DNN. We evaluate SubFlow with three popular DNN models (LeNet-5, AlexNet, and KWS), which shows that it provides flexible run-time execution and increases the utility of a DNN under dynamic timing constraints, e.g., 1x-6.7x range of dynamic execution speed with average -3% of performance (inference accuracy) difference.

Traditional locomotive equipment inspection is carried out manually on-site by workers, and the task is exhausting, cumbersome, and unsafe. Based on computer vision and machine learning, this paper presents an approach to the automatic detection of the locomotive speed sensor equipment, an important device in locomotives. Challenges to the detection of speed sensor mainly concerns complex background, motion blur, muddy noise, and variable shapes. In this paper, a cascade learning framework is proposed, which includes two learning stages: target localization and speed sensor detection, to reduce the complexity of the research object and solve the imbalance of samples. In the first stage, histogram of oriented gradient feature and support vector machine (HOG-SVM) model is used for multi-scale detection. Then, an improved LeNet-5 model is adopted in the second stage. To solve the problem of the imbalance of positive and negative samples of speed sensor, a combination strategy which draws on four individual classifiers is designed to construct an ensemble of classifier for recognition, and the results of three different algorithms are compared. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach is effective and robust with respect to changes in speed sensor patterns for robust equipment identification.","[Li, Bo; Zhou, Sisi; Cheng, Lifang; Zhu, Rongbo; Hu, Tao; Zou, Yongkai] South Cent Univ Nationalities, Coll Comp Sci, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Anjum, Ashiq] Univ Derby, Coll Engn & Technol, Derby DE22 1GB, England; [He, Zheng] Wuhan Japir Technol Co Ltd, Wuhan 430000, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Zhu, RB (corresponding author), South Cent Univ Nationalities, Coll Comp Sci, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",rbzhu@mail.scuec.edu.cn,,"Zhu, Rongbo/0000-0003-1620-0560",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [CZP19004]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61772562]; Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars [2017CFA043]; Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Foundation of China [2018ABB1485]; Youth Elite Project of State Ethnic Affairs Commission of China,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars; Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Foundation of China; Youth Elite Project of State Ethnic Affairs Commission of China,"This work was supported in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant CZP19004, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61772562, in part by the Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars under Grant 2017CFA043, in part by the Hubei Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Foundation of China under Grant 2018ABB1485, and in part by the Youth Elite Project of State Ethnic Affairs Commission of China under Grant 2016.",,42,5,5,2,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019.0,7,,,,,,90851,90862,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2928224,0.0,,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,IM3AP,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000477864400004,0

Directly regularizing or modifying weight values makes pruning procedure less robust and sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and it also requires prior knowledge to tune different hyperparameters for different models. To build a better generalized and easy-to-use pruning method, we propose AutoPrune, which prunes the network through optimizing a set of trainable auxiliary parameters instead of original weights. The instability and noise during training on auxiliary parameters will not directly affect weight values, which makes pruning process more robust to noise and less sensitive to hyperparameters. Moreover, we design gradient update rules for auxiliary parameters to keep them consistent with pruning tasks. Our method can automatically eliminate network redundancy with recoverability, relieving the complicated prior knowledge required to design thresholding functions, and reducing the time for trial and error. We evaluate our method with LeNet and VGG-like on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, and with AlexNet, ResNet and MobileNet on ImageNet to establish the scalability of our work.

Robustness is used to measure the applicability of machine learning algorithms to adversarial attack. Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm is a anti-noise and robust machine learning technique. It shows good robustness when dealing with issues such as document classification and spam filtering. Here we propose two novel label flipping attacks to evaluate the robustness of NB under label noise. For the three datasets of Spambase, TREC 2006c and TREC 2007 in the spam classification domain, our attack goal is to increase the false negative rate of NB under the influence of label noise without affecting normal mail classification. Our evaluation shows that at a noise level of 20%, the false negative rate of Spambase and TREC 2006c has increased by about 20%, and the test error of the TREC 2007 dataset has increased to nearly 30%. We compared the classification accuracy of five classic machine learning algorithms (random forest(RF), support vector machine(SVM), decision tree(DT), logistic regression(LR), and NB) and two deep learning models(AlexNet, LeNet) under the proposed label flipping attacks.

The proposed framework is based on reconfiguring a streaming datapath at runtime to cover the training cycle for the various layers in a CNN. The streaming datapath can support various parameterized modules which can be customized to produce implementations with different trade-offs in performance and resource usage. The modules follow the same input and output data layout, simplifying configuration scheduling. For different layers, instances of the modules contain different computation kernels in parallel, which can be customized with different layer configurations and data precision. The associated models on performance, resource and bandwidth can be used in deriving parameters for the datapath to guide the analysis of design trade-offs to meet application requirements or platform constraints. They enable estimation of the implementation specifications given different layer configurations, to maximize performance under the constraints on bandwidth and hardware resources. Experimental results indicate that the proposed module design targeting Maxeler technology can achieve a performance of 62.06 GFLOPS for 32-bit floating-point arithmetic, outperforming existing accelerators. Further evaluation based on training LeNet-5 shows that the proposed framework achieves about 4 times faster than CPU implementation of Caffe and about 7.5 times more energy efficient than the GPU implementation of Caffe.","[Zhao, Wenlai; Fu, Haohuan; Feng, Bo; Ma, Yuchun; Yang, Guangwen] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Wenlai; Fu, Haohuan; Yang, Guangwen] Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Wenlai; Fu, Haohuan; Yang, Guangwen] Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Wenlai; Fu, Haohuan; Yang, Guangwen] Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Luk, Wayne; Yu, Teng] Imperial Coll London, Dept Comp, London, England; [Wang, Shaojun] Harbin Inst Technol, Dept Automat Test & Control, Harbin, Peoples R China",,"Zhao, WL (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhao, WL (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhao, WL (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Ctr Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhao, WL (corresponding author), Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhao-wl11@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; haohuan@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61303003, 41374113]; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program [20131089356]; European Union Horizon 2020 Programme [671653]; UK EPSRC [EP/I012036/1, EP/L00058X/1]; Maxeler University Program; Altera",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program; European Union Horizon 2020 Programme; UK EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Maxeler University Program; Altera,"This work is supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61303003, 41374113), by Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program (Grant No. 20131089356), by European Union Horizon 2020 Programme with project reference 671653, by UK EPSRC (grant reference EP/I012036/1 and EP/L00058X/1), and by the Maxeler University Program and by Altera.",,17,58,61,2,23,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2160-0511,2160-052X,978-1-5090-1503-0,IEEE INT CONF ASAP,,,2016.0,,,,,,,107,114,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BG8BZ,,Green Submitted,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000392195600014,0

We propose a low cost approximation of the Delta method applicable to L-2-regularized deep neural networks based on the top K eigenpairs of the Fisher information matrix. We address efficient computation of full-rank approximate eigendecompositions in terms of the exact inverse Hessian, the inverse outer-products of gradients approximation and the so-called Sandwich estimator. Moreover, we provide bounds on the approximation error for the uncertainty of the predictive class probabilities. We show that when the smallest computed eigenvalue of the Fisher information matrix is near the L-2-regularization rate, the approximation error will be close to zero even when K << P. A demonstration of the methodology is presented using a TensorFlow implementation, and we show that meaningful rankings of images based on predictive uncertainty can be obtained for two LeNet and ResNet-based neural networks using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Further, we observe that false positives have on average a higher predictive epistemic uncertainty than true positives.

A network adapted from the CIFAR-10 LeNet architecture in Ni ATLA 13.

After the network classified with almost perfect accuracy, the synthetic data was replaced with corresponding measured data. Only the first layer of filters was permitted to change in order to create a translation layer between synthetic and measured data. The low error rate of this experiment demonstrates that diverse clutter and target types not represented in measured training data may be introduced in synthetic training data and later recognized in measured test data.","[Arnold, Julia M.] MIT, 450 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Moore, Linda J.; Zelnio, Edmund G.] US Air Force Res Lab, Sensors Directorate, Wright Patterson AFB, OH USA",,"Arnold, JM (corresponding author), MIT, 450 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",jul@mit.edu,,,,,,,6,5,5,1,3,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,978-1-5106-1806-0,PROC SPIE,,,2018.0,10647,,,,,,,,UNSP 106470A,10.1117/12.2304568,0.0,,,10,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Optics,BL6CH,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000453306500005,0

However, gaining insight into the fundamentals and explaining their functionality is an open research area of high interest. In this paper, we use an information theoretic approach to reveal typical learning patterns of ANNs. For this purpose the training samples, the true labels, and the estimated labels are considered as random variables. Then, the mutual information and conditional entropy between these variables are studied. We show that the learning process of ANNs consists of essentially two phases. First, the network learns mostly about the input samples without significant improvement in the accuracy, thereafter the correct class allocation becomes more pronounced. This is based on investigating the conditional entropy of the estimated class label given the true one in the course of training. We next derive bounds on the conditional entropy as a function of the error probability, which provide interesting insights into the learning behavior of ANNs. Theoretical investigations are accompanied by extensive numerical studies on an artificial data set as well as the MNIST and CIFAR benchmark data using the widely known networks LeNet-5 and DenseNet. Amazingly, in all cases the bounds are nearly attained in later stages of the training phase, which allows for an analytical measure of the training status of an ANN.","[Balda, Emilio Rafael; Behboodi, Arash; Mathar, Rudolf] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Theoret Informat Technol, D-52056 Aachen, Germany",,"Balda, ER (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Theoret Informat Technol, D-52056 Aachen, Germany.",balda@ti.rwth-aachen.de; behboodi@ti.rwth-aachen.de; mathar@ti.rwth-aachen.de,"Behboodi, Arash/AFM-0515-2022; Behboodi, Arash/AAH-2889-2022",,DFG [SCoSNeL-MA 1184/36-1],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was partially supported by the DFG grant SCoSNeL-MA 1184/36-1 in the priority program CoSIP.,,25,5,5,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-5602-0,,,,2018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Telecommunications,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Telecommunications,BM0DH,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000458665600047,0

Advances in machine learning and deep learning make it possible to envision the automation of many complex tasks in various fields of science at an accuracy equal to human performance, thereby, avoiding placing human resources into tedious and repetitive tasks, improving time efficiency, and lowering costs. Here, we develop deep-learning algorithms to automate the recognition of minerals directly from the grains captured from optical microscopes.

With the gradual complication of modern industrial machinery and equipment, it has become more difficult for traditional feature extractors to achieve the desired results. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been developed as effective techniques for fault classification but require large-scale high-intensity computing and prohibitive hardware resource requirements. This paper proposes a lightweight CNN that can be easily used for the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery by adjusting the network structure and optimizing the network. First, the raw vibration acceleration signal is transformed into a two-dimensional gray image. Second, two mature and commonly used modules named LeNet and NIN are combined to form a new model with a simple structure. Then, through parameter adjustment and optimization, an improved and optimized CNN with a lightweight structure and fewer parameters is constructed. The experimental verification has shown that this method has high accuracy and stability in fault diagnosis. Finally, the application of this new network for the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings with different damage levels but similar fault types shows high diagnostic accuracy and good generalization ability. In addition, we attempt to explain how the feature filters of a CNN work by visualizing the convolutional layer of the network.","[Lu, Yuqi; Mi, Jinhua; Liang, He; Cheng, Yuhua; Bai, Libing] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Automat Engn, 2006 Xiyuan Ave, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China; [Mi, Jinhua] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Ctr Syst Reliabil & Safety, Chengdu, Peoples R China",,"Mi, JH (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Automat Engn, 2006 Xiyuan Ave, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China.",jinhuami@uestc.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51805073, U1830207]; Sichuan Science and Technology Project [2019JDJQ0015]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M582536]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sichuan Science and Technology Project; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Contact No. 51805073 and U1830207, the Sichuan Science and Technology Project under contract No. 2019JDJQ0015, and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under contract No. 2015M582536.",,45,2,2,3,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1748-006X,1748-0078,,P I MECH ENG O-J RIS,Proc.

State-of-the-art CNN models for large-scale applications are computation intensive and memory expensive and, hence, are mainly processed on high-performance processors like server CPUs and GPUs. However, there is an increasing demand of high-accuracy or real-time object detection tasks in large-scale clusters or embedded systems, which requires energy-efficient accelerators because of the green computation requirement or the limited battery restriction. Due to the advantages of energy efficiency and reconfigurability, Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been widely explored as CNN accelerators. In this article, we present an in-depth analysis of computation complexity and the memory footprint of each CNN layer type. Then a scalable parallel framework is proposed that exploits four levels of parallelism in hardware acceleration. We further put forward a systematic design space exploration methodology to search for the optimal solution that maximizes accelerator throughput under the FPGA constraints such as on-chip memory, computational resources, external memory bandwidth, and clock frequency. Finally, we demonstrate the methodology by optimizing three representative CNNs (LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG-S) on a Xilinx VC709 board. The average performance of the three accelerators is 424.7, 445.6, and 473.4GOP/s under 100MHz working frequency, which outperforms the CPU and previous work significantly.","[Liu, Zhiqiang; Dou, Yong; Jiang, Jingfei; Xu, Jinwei; Li, Shijie; Zhou, Yongmei; Xu, Yingnan] Natl Univ Def Technol, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China",,"Liu, ZQ (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China.",liuzhiqiang@nudt.edu.cn; yongdou@nudt.edu.cn; jingfeijiang@nudt.edu.cn; xujinwei13@nudt.edu.cn; lishijienudt@163.com; yongmei0102@163.com; yingnanpearl@163.com,"Sharifymoghaddam, Sayeh/R-6433-2018",,"National Science Foundation of China [U1435219, 61303070, 61402507, 61402499]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work is funded by National Science Foundation of China under Grant No. U1435219, 61303070, 61402507, and 61402499.",,20,48,51,1,77,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1936-7406,1936-7414,,ACM T RECONFIG TECHN,ACM T.

In this study, we propose a segmentation method of cervical intervertebral disks (CIDs) in videofluorography (VF) by use of patch-based convolutional neural network (CNN), our multi-channelization (MC) method and image feature selection. Methods Twenty image filters are individually applied to a VF frame image to generate feature images. One color image, called a multi-channelized image, is generated by setting three selected feature images to its red, green and blue channels. Patch-based CNN is applied to the MC image, and the segmentation accuracy of CIDs is evaluated by the pixel-based F-measure. The combination of the three feature images is optimized by the simulated annealing method. Results The proposed method was applied to actual VF dataset consisting of 19 patients and 39 healthy participants. The segmentation accuracy was 59.3% in the F-measure when Sobel and morphological top-hat filters were selected in MC, whereas it was 56.2% when original frame images were used. Conclusion The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method was able to segment CIDs from actual VF and also that the MC method was able to increase the segmentation accuracy by approximately 3%. In this study, LeNet was used as CNN. One of our future tasks is to use other CNNs.","[Fujinaka, Ayano; Takizawa, Hotaka; Kudo, Hiroyuki] Univ Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan; [Mekata, Kojiro] Kobe Red Cross Hosp, Dept Rehabil, Chuo Ku, 1-3-1 Wakinohamakaigandori, Kobe, Hyogo 6510073, Japan",,"Fujinaka, A; Takizawa, H (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan.",s1830149@s.tsukuba.ac.jp; takizawa@cs.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1861-6410,1861-6429,,INT J COMPUT ASS RAD,Int.

The training process has been done using DiGITS and the output is a caffemodel used for predictions to detect vacant and occupied parking spots. The system checks a defined area whether a parking spot (bounding boxes defined at initialization of the system) is containing a car or not (occupied or vacant). Those bounding boxes coordinates are saved from a frame of the video of the parking lot in a JSON format, to be later used by the system for sequential prediction on each parking spot. The system has been trained using the LeNet network with the Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient as solver and the AlexNet network with the Stochastic Gradient Descent as solver. We were able to get an accuracy on the validation set of 99% for both networks. The accuracy on a foreign dataset(PKLot) returned as well 99%.

Nevertheless, due to the computation-intensive and memory-intensive character of CNN, general-purpose processors which usually need to support various workloads are not efficient for CNN implementation. Therefore, a great deal of emerging CNN-specific hardware accelerators is able to improve efficiency. Although existing accelerators are significantly efficient, they are often inflexible or require complex controllers to handle calculations and data transfer. In this paper, we analyze classical CNN applications and design a domain-specific instruction set of 9 matrix instructions, called RV-CNN, based on the promising RISC-V architecture. By abstracting CNN into instructions, our design possesses a higher code density and provides sufficient flexibility and efficiency for CNN than general-purpose ISAs. Specifically, the proposed instructions are extended to RISC-V ISA as custom instructions. Besides, we also introduce micro-architectural optimizations to increase computational density and reduce the required memory bandwidth. Finally, we implement the architecture with the extended ISA and evaluate it with LeNet-5 on the datasets (MNIST, Caltech101, and Cifar-10).

However, if not appropriately used, low-precision implementation can deteriorate its convergence because of the rounding error when gradients become small near a local optimum. In this work, to balance throughput and algorithmic accuracy, we apply the Q-learning technique to adjust the precision of SGD automatically by designing an appropriate decision function. The proposed decision function for Q-learning takes the error rate of the objective function, its gradients, and the current precision configuration as the inputs. Q-learning then chooses proper precision adaptively for hardware efficiency and algorithmic accuracy. We use reconfigurable devices such as FPGAs to evaluate the adaptive precision configurations generated by the proposed Q-learning method. We prototype the framework using LeNet-5 model with MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets and implement it on a Xilinx KCU1500 FPGA board. In the experiments, we analyze the throughput of different precision representations and the precision-selection of our framework.

In this paper, we formally establish filter pruning as a multiobjective optimization problem, and propose a knee-guided evolutionary algorithm (KGEA) that can automatically search for the solution with quality tradeoff between the scale of parameters and performance, in which both conflicting objectives can be optimized simultaneously. In particular, by incorporating a minimum Manhattan distance approach, the search effort in the proposed KGEA is explicitly guided toward the knee area, which greatly facilitates the manual search for a good tradeoff solution. Moreover, the parameter importance is directly estimated on the criterion of performance loss, which can robustly identify the redundancy. In addition to the knee solution, a performance-improved model can also be found in a fine-tuning-free fashion. The experiments on compressing fully convolutional LeNet and VGG-19 networks validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art competing methods.","[Zhou, Yao; Yi, Zhang] Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China; [Yen, Gary G.] Oklahoma State Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",,"Yen, GG (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",zy3381@gmail.com; gyen@okstate.edu; zhangyi@scu.edu.cn,,"Yen, Gary/0000-0001-8851-5348","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61432012, 61772353]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61432012 and Grant 61772353.

Since every region has a distinct number plate format and style, an unconstrained ANPR system is still not available. There is not much work done on Pakistani number plates because of the unavailability of the data and heterogeneous plate formations. Addressing this issue, we have collected a Pakistani vehicle dataset having various plate configurations and developed a novel ANPR framework using the dataset. The proposed framework localizes the number plate region using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model, applies robust preprocessing techniques on the extracted plate region, and finally recognizes the plate label using OCR (optical character recognition) Tesseract. The obtained mAP score of the YOLOv3 is 94.3% and the YOLOv4 model is 99.5% on the 0.50 threshold, whereas the average accuracy score of our framework is found to be 73%. For comparison and validation, we implemented a LeNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which uses the segmented image as an input. The comparative analysis shows that the proposed ANPR framework comprising the YOLOv4 and OCR Tesseract has good accuracy and inference time for a wide variation of illumination and style of Pakistani number plates and can be used to develop a real-time system. The proposed ANPR framework will be helpful for researchers developing ANPR for countries having similar challenging vehicle number plate formats and styles.","[Salma; Saeed, Maham; Rahim, Rauf Ur; Khan, Muhammad Gufran; Zulfiqar, Adil; Bhatti, Muhammad Tahir] Natl Univ Comp & Emerging Sci Islamabad, Dept Elect Engn, Chiniot Faisalabad Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan",,"Khan, MG (corresponding author), Natl Univ Comp & Emerging Sci Islamabad, Dept Elect Engn, Chiniot Faisalabad Campus, Islamabad, Pakistan.",m.gufran@nu.edu.pk,,,"National University of Computer and Emerging Science, Chiniot Campus Pakistan; Internal National University of Computer and Emerging Science (NUCES) Universityy research grant for faculty","National University of Computer and Emerging Science, Chiniot Campus Pakistan; Internal National University of Computer and Emerging Science (NUCES) Universityy research grant for faculty","This work was supported in part by the National University of Computer and Emerging Science, Chiniot Campus Pakistan.The research work was funded by an Internal National University of Computer and Emerging Science (NUCES) University research grant for faculty.",,33,1,1,0,0,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1076-2787,1099-0526,,COMPLEXITY,Complexity,OCT 19,2021.0,2021,,,,,,,,5597337,10.1155/2021/5597337,0.0,,,14,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,3Y2GI,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000843546200001,0

In this paper, a PV array reconfiguration method is developed to minimize power losses of PV arrays under partial shading conditions. The proposed reconfiguration method is based on equalizing the reduction of the short-circuit current of the PV modules in the PV array. Eight state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network models are employed to estimate the effect of shading on the short-circuit current of a PV module. These models include LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG 11, VGG 19, Inception V3, ResNet 18, ResNet 34, and ResNet 50. Among eight models, the VGG 19 achieves the best accuracy on 1842 sample images. Therefore, this model is used to estimate the ratio of the actual short-circuit current and the estimated short-circuit current in four studied shading scenarios. This ratio decides the switching rule between PV modules throughout the PV array under PSC. A 2x2 experimental PV array shows that the proposed reconfiguration method improves the output power from 5.81% to 25.19% in four shading patterns. Accordingly, the power losses are reduced from 1.32% to 13.75%. The power improvement and the reduction of power losses of the proposed dynamic PV array reconfiguration system under four case studies demonstrates its effectiveness in addressing the effects of PSC on the PV array.","[Tuyen Nguyen-Duc; Thinh Le-Viet; Duong Nguyen-Dang; Tung Dao-Quang; Minh Bui-Quang] Hanoi Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Tuyen Nguyen-Duc] Shibaura Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Tokyo 1358548, Japan",,"Tuyen, ND (corresponding author), Hanoi Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam.;Tuyen, ND (corresponding author), Shibaura Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Tokyo 1358548, Japan.",tuyen.nguyenduc@hust.edu.vn,,"NguyenDuc, TUYEN/0000-0001-7107-3897",Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) [T2020-SAHEP-005],Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST),This research is funded by the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) under project number T2020-SAHEP-005.,,38,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,SEP,2022.0,15,17,,,,,,,6341,10.3390/en15176341,0.0,,,21,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,4J1FN,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000851016400001,0

A number of recent efforts have integrated AIMC arrays into hybrid digital-analog accelerators in a multi-layer parallel manner to achieve energy efficiency and high throughput. Multi-layer parallelism on large-scale tile-based architectures need efficient mapping support at the processing element (PE)-level (e.g., digital or analog processing elements) and tile-level. To find the most efficient architectures, fast and accurate design space exploration (DSE) support is required. In this paper, a novel DSE framework, AERO, is presented to characterize a CNN inference workload executing on hybrid tile-based architectures that supports multi-layer parallelism. Three characteristics can be seen in our DSE framework: (1) It presents a hierarchical Tile/PE-level mapping exploration strategy including inter-layer interaction, and allowing layer fusion/splitting configurations for PE-level mapping optimization. (2) It unlocks different Performance, Power and Area (PPA) exploration points under both sufficient and limited resource constraints, while limited resource case is not considered in prior works of multi-layer parallel architectures. The impact of weight loading and weight stationary mapping are analyzed for better insights into hybrid tile-based architectures. (3) It incorporates a detailed PPA model that supports a broad range of hybrid digital and analog units in a tile.

Deep learning techniques for motion control have recently taken a major qualitative step since vision-based inference tasks can be executed directly on edge. The goal is to fully integrate the machine learning (ML) element into small UAVs. However, given the limited payload capacity and energy available on small UAVs, integrating computing resources sufficient to host ML and vehicle control functions is still challenging. This paper presents a modular and generic system that can control the UAV by evaluating vision-based ML tasks directly inside the resource-constrained UAV. Two different vision-based navigation configurations were tested and demonstrated. The first configuration implements an autonomous landing site detection system, tested with two models based on LeNet-5 and MobileNetV2, respectively. This allows the UAV to change its planned path accordingly and approach the target to land. Moreover, a model for people detection based on a custom MobileNetV2 network was evaluated in the second configuration. Finally, the execution time and power consumption were measured and compared with a cloud computing approach. The results show the ability of the developed system to dynamically react to the environment to provide the necessary maneuver after detecting the target exploiting only the constrained computational resources of the UAV controller. Furthermore, we demonstrated that moving to the edge, instead of using cloud computing inference, decreases the energy requirement of the system without reducing the quality of service.","[Albanese, Andrea; Nardello, Matteo; Brunelli, Davide] Univ Trento, Dept Ind Engn, Via Sommar 9, I-38123 Trento, Italy",,"Albanese, A (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Dept Ind Engn, Via Sommar 9, I-38123 Trento, Italy.",andrea.albanese@unitn.it,,"Albanese, Andrea/0000-0002-0483-6732",Italian Ministry for University and Research (MUR),"Italian Ministry for University and Research (MUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))",All authors approved the version of the manuscript to be published.

To this end, the paper proposes an efficient system based on five neural networks to assess the degree of flooding and the remaining vegetation. After a previous analysis the following neural networks were selected as primary classifiers: you only look once network (YOLO), generative adversarial network (GAN), AlexNet, LeNet, and residual network (ResNet). Their outputs were connected in a decision fusion scheme, as a new convolutional layer, considering two sets of components: (a) the weights, corresponding to the proven accuracy of the primary neural networks in the validation phase, and (b) the probabilities generated by the neural networks as primary classification results in the operational (testing) phase. Thus, a subjective behavior (individual interpretation of single neural networks) was transformed into a more objective behavior (interpretation based on fusion of information). The images, difficult to be segmented, were obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetry flight after a moderate flood in a rural region of Romania and make up our database. For segmentation and evaluation of the flooded zones and vegetation, the images were first decomposed in patches and, after classification the resulting marked patches were re-composed in segmented images. From the performance analysis point of view, better results were obtained with the proposed system than the neural networks taken separately and with respect to some works from the references.","[Ichim, Loretta; Popescu, Dan] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Fac Automat Control & Comp, Bucharest 060042, Romania",,"Popescu, D (corresponding author), Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Fac Automat Control & Comp, Bucharest 060042, Romania.",loretta.ichim@upb.ro; dan.popescu@upb.ro,,,University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest,University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest,This research was funding by University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest.,,49,3,3,2,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,AUG,2020.0,12,15,,,,,,,2490,10.3390/rs12152490,0.0,,,29,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,NL3XE,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000567352300001,0

The abnormal traffic detection and analysis by extracting the statistical features of flow is the main analysis method in the field of network intrusion detection. However, these features need to be designed and extracted manually, which often loses the original information of the flow and leads to poor detection efficiency. In this paper, we do not manually design the features of the flow but directly extract the raw data information of the flow for analysis. In addition, we first proposed a new network intrusion detection model named the deep hierarchical network, which integrates the improved LeNet-5 and LSTM neural network structures, while learning the spatial and temporal features of flow. By designing a reasonable network cascading method, we can train our proposed hierarchical network at the same time instead of training two networks separately. In this paper, we use the CICIDS2017 dataset and the CTU dataset. The number and types of flow in these two datasets are large, and the attack types are relatively new. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed hierarchical network model is significantly better than other network intrusion detection models, which can achieve the best detection accuracy.

With the emergence of edge computing, one can attempt to deploy the pattern recognition algorithm to the farmland environment and monitor the growth of crops promptly. However, due to the limited resources of the edge device, the original deep recognition model is challenging to apply. Due to this, in this article, a recognition model based on a depthwise separable convolutional neural network (DSCNN) is proposed, which operation particularities include a significant reduction in the number of parameters and the amount of computation, making the proposed design well suited for the edge.

Moreover, there is an intrinsic bias in these adversarial attacks and defences to make matters worse. Here, we organise the problems faced: a) Model Dependence, b) Insufficient Evaluation, c) False Adversarial Samples, and d) Perturbation Dependent Results. Based on this, we propose a model agnostic adversarial robustness assessment method based on L-0 and L-infinity distance-based norms and the concept of robustness levels to tackle the problems. We validate our robustness assessment on several neural network architectures (WideResNet, ResNet, AllConv, DenseNet, NIN, LeNet and CapsNet) and adversarial defences for image classification problem. The proposed robustness assessment reveals that the robustness may vary significantly depending on the metric used (i.e., L-0 or L-infinity). Hence, the duality should be taken into account for a correct evaluation. Moreover, a mathematical derivation and a counter-example suggest that L-1 and L-2 metrics alone are not sufficient to avoid spurious adversarial samples. Interestingly, the threshold attack of the proposed assessment is a novel L-infinity black-box adversarial method which requires even more minor perturbation than the One-Pixel Attack (only 12% of One-Pixel Attack's amount of perturbation) to achieve similar results. We further show that all current networks and defences are vulnerable at all levels of robustness, suggesting that current networks and defences are only effective against a few attacks keeping the models vulnerable to different types of attacks.","[Kotyan, Shashank; Vargas, Danilo Vasconcellos] Kyushu Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Engn, Fukuoka, Japan; [Vargas, Danilo Vasconcellos] Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Elect Engn & Informat Syst, Tokyo, Japan",,"Kotyan, S (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Engn, Fukuoka, Japan.",shashankkotyan@gmail.com,,,JSPS KAKENHI [JP20241216]; JST-Act-I Grant [JP-50243],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); JST-Act-I Grant","DV, JST-Act-I Grant Number JP-50243, https://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/act-i/index.html.DV, JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP20241216, https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-grants/.",,65,0,0,1,1,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,,2022.0,17,4,,,,,,,e0265723,10.1371/journal.pone.0265723,0.0,,,22,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,1F9AX,35421125.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000795453600028,0

Indeed, as needs increase for searchability of vast printed document image collections, powerful CNNs have been used in place of conventional image processing. However, better performances of deep CNNs come at the expense of computational complexity. Are the additional training efforts required by deeper CNNs worth the improvement in performance? Or could a shallow CNN coupled with conventional image processing (e.g., binarization and consolidation) outperform deeper CNNbased solutions? We investigate performance gaps among shallow (LeNet-5, -7, and -9), deep (ResNet-18), and very deep (ResNet-152, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet) CNNs for noisy printed document images, e.g., historical newspapers and document images in the RVL-CDIP repository. Our investigation considers two different classification tasks: (1) identifying poems in historical newspapers and (2) classifying 16 document types in document images. Empirical results show that a shallow CNN coupled with computationally inexpensive preprocessing can have a robust response with significantly reduced training samples; deep CNNs coupled with preprocessing can outperform very deep CNNs effectively and efficiently; and aggressive preprocessing is not helpful as it could remove potentially useful information in document images.

Due to the complexity and computation load, CNNs are trained on a cloud environment. There are a couple of drawbacks on learning and performing on the cloud such as security problem of personal information and dependency of communication state. Recently, CNNs are directly trained at the mobile devices in order to alleviate those two drawbacks. Due to the resource limitation of the mobile devices, the structure of CNNs needs to be compressed or to reduce training overhead. In this paper, we propose an on-device partial learning technique with the following benefits: (1) does not require additional neural network structures, and (2) reduces unnecessary computation overhead. We select a subset of influential weights from a trained network to accommodate the new classification class. The selection is made based on the information of the contribution of each weight to output, which is measured using the entropy concept. In the experimental section, we demonstrate and analyze our method with a CNN image classifier using two datasets such as Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology image data and Microsoft Common Objection in Context data. As a result, the computational resources at LeNet-5 and AlexNet showed performance improvements of 1.7x and 2.3x, respectively, and memory resources demonstrated performance improvements of 1.4x and 1.6x, respectively.","[Hur, Cheonghwan; Kang, Sanggil] Inha Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Inha Ro 100, Incheon 22212, South Korea",,"Kang, S (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Inha Ro 100, Incheon 22212, South Korea.",sgkang@inha.ac.kr,,"heocheonghwan, /hagsaeng/keompyuteogonghag/0000-0002-5028-1782",Inha University Grant,Inha University Grant,This work was supported by Inha University Grant.,,59,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1939-8018,1939-8115,,J SIGNAL PROCESS SYS,J.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular are being used widely due to the impressive performance in various application areas. FPGAs, on the other hand, are becoming a promising hardware platform for various deep learning algorithms including CNN. However, optimized and efficient FPGA design requires an expert with hardware design skills. This is particularly a challenge for deep learning practitioners who would like to accelerate their algorithm without worrying about the underlying hardware knowledge required to accomplish that in FPGAs. In this work we are proposing an automated framework, MulMapper, that can generate a functional and synthesized CNN processor hardware IP (using Vivado HLS) for Zynq-based FPGAs, given Caffe-based CNN definition fie. We created a dynamic and novel design space utilizing Target Device Resource, Target Core Mode and Target Data Width as design space dimensions. MulMapper explores the design space in these three dimensions and proposes the optimum design points. We tested MulMapper framework on common CNN architectures, LeNet, CNP and CIFAR-10. It has been verified that early-stage MulMapper can lead to synthesis of resource-optimized CNN processor hardware IP that can be used for many regular CNN variants. Comparison with the state-of-the-art shows that architectures generated using MulMapper obtained up to 25-29x DSP48 and 13-20x on-chip memory reduction, with up to 0.35 GOP/sec performance.","[Hailesellasie, Muluken; Hasan, Syed Rafay] Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA; [Mohamed, Otmane Ait] Concordia Univ, ECE Dept, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,"Hailesellasie, M (corresponding author), Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA.",mthailesel42@students.tntech.edu; shasan@tntech.edu; ait@ece.concordia.ca,,,,,,,19,2,2,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0271-4302,,978-1-7281-0397-6,IEEE INT SYMP CIRC S,,,2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BN5FJ,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000483076402057,0

However, DNN models are essentially uninterpretable to humans, and unfortunately prone to adversarial attacks, which hinders their adoption in security and safety-critical scenarios. The robustness of a DNN model, which measures its stableness against adversarial attacks, becomes an important topic in both the machine learning and the software engineering communities. Analytical evaluation of DNN robustness is difficult due to the high-dimensionality of inputs, the huge amount of parameters, and the nonlinear network structure. In practice, the degree of robustness of DNNs is empirically approximated with adversarial searching, which is computationally expensive and cannot be applied in resource constrained settings such as embedded computing. In this paper, we propose to predict the robustness of a DNN model for each input with another DNN model, which takes the output of neurons of the former model as input. We train a regression model to encode the connections between output of the penultimate layer of a DNN model and its robustness. With this trained model, the robustness for an input can be predicted instantaneously. Experiments with MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets and LeNet, VGG and ResNet DNN models were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach. The results indicated that our approach achieved 0.05-0.21 mean absolute errors and significantly outperformed confidence and surprise adequacy-based approaches.

The excellent performance of the convolutional neural network in image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks motivates us to apply it to CME detection and tracking as well. We developed a new tool for CME Automatic detection and tracking with MachinE Learning (CAMEL) techniques. The system is a three-module pipeline. It is first a supervised image classification problem. We solve it by training a neural network LeNet with training labels obtained from an existing CME catalog. Those images containing CME structures are flagged as CME images. Next, to identify the CME region in each CME-flagged image, we use deep descriptor transforming to localize the common object in an image set. A following step is to apply the graph cut technique to finely tune the detected CME region. To track the CME in an image sequence, the binary images with detected CME pixels are converted from a cartesian to a polar coordinate. A CME event is labeled if it can move in at least two frames and reach the edge of the coronagraph field of view. For each event, a few fundamental parameters are derived. The results of four representative CMEs with various characteristics are presented and compared with those from four existing automatic and manual catalogs. We find that CAMEL can detect more complete and weaker structures and has better performance to catch a CME as early as possible.","[Wang, Pengyu; Zhang, Yan; Yuan, Hanqing; Gan, Yuan] Nanjing Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Feng, Li; Li, Shuting; Lu, Lei; Ying, Beili; Gan, Weiqun; Li, Hui] Chinese Acad Sci, Purple Mt Observ, Key Lab Dark Matter & Space Astron, Nanjing 210034, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Shuting; Ying, Beili] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Astron & Space Sci, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhangyannju@nju.edu.cn; lfeng@pmo.ac.cn,"Feng, Li/G-2100-2015","Lu, Lei/0000-0002-3032-6066; Li, Hui/0000-0003-1078-3021; feng, li/0000-0003-4655-6939","NSFC [11522328, 11473070, 11427803, U1731241]; CAS Strategic Pioneer Program on Space Science [XDA15010600, XDA15052200, XDA15320103, XDA15320301]; national key research and development program [2018YFA0404202]",NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS Strategic Pioneer Program on Space Science; national key research and development program,"The CDAW CME catalog is generated and maintained at the CDAW Data Center by NASA and The Catholic University of America in cooperation with the Naval Research Laboratory.

The bit width of the data directly affects the memory footprint, computing capability, and energy consumption during the computation of the DNN models. Although there have been numerous existing studies on data quantization, there is still no quantitative analysis of the existing quantization methods, which results in empirical quantization with unpredictable DNN accuracy loss. To address this problem, we propose an effective method, called ultra-low loss quantization (mu L2Q), to provide DNN quantization schemes based on comprehensive quantitative data analysis. mu L2Q builds the transformation of the original data to a data space with standard normal distribution, and then find the optimal parameters to minimize the loss of the quantization of a targeted bit width. In addition, we integrate the proposed mu L2Q into a popular machine learning framework Caffe for convenient end-to-end DNN design and training. By comparing to the state-of-the-art DNN compression designs, mu L2Q shows the greatest ability to maintain DNN accuracy after quantization. In the experiments, our proposed method can deliver 4.42%, 16.70%, 1.95%, 8.26% and 5.63% accuracy improvements on Lenet-5, Cifarnet, VGG7-64 and Resnet-18 (Top1/5), respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art solutions with the same compression ratio.","[Gong, Cheng; Li, Tao; Lu, Ye] Nankai Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Hao, Cong; Zhang, Xiaofan; Chen, Deming] Univ Illinois, Champaign, IL USA; [Chen, Yao] Adv Digital Sci Ctr, Singapore, Singapore",,"Lu, Y (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",cheng-gong@rnail.nankai.edu.cn; litao@nankai.edu.cn; luye@nankai.edu.cn; cough@illinois.edu; xiaofan3@illinois.edu; dchen@illinois.edu; yao.chen@adsc-create.edu.sg,"Chen, Yao/AAW-9689-2021","Chen, Yao/0000-0002-5798-2282","National Natural Science Foundation [61872200]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0400709, 2018YFB1003405]; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin [18YFYZCG00060]; National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme; IBM-Illinois Center for Cognitive Computing System Research (C3SR) - a research collaboration as part of IBM AI Horizons Network","National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin(Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin); National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) programme(National Research Foundation, Singapore); IBM-Illinois Center for Cognitive Computing System Research (C3SR) - a research collaboration as part of IBM AI Horizons Network(International Business Machines (IBM))","This work is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (61872200), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0400709, 2018YFB1003405), the Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin (18YFYZCG00060).

IR-based ATR can provide accurate recognition because of its high image resolution but it is affected by the weather conditions. On the other hand, SAR-based ATR shows a low recognition rate due to the noisy low resolution but can provide consistent performance regardless of the weather conditions. The fusion of an active sensor (SAR) and a passive sensor (IR) can lead to upgraded performance. This paper proposes a doubly weighted neural network fusion scheme at the decision level. The first weight can measure the offline sensor confidence per target category based on the classification rate for an evaluation set. The second weight ) can measure the online sensor reliability based on the score distribution for a test target image. The LeNet architecture-based deep convolution network (14 layers) is used as an individual classifier. Doubly weighted sensor scores are fused by two types of fusion schemes, such as the sum-based linear fusion scheme (sum) and neural network-based nonlinear fusion scheme (-NN). The experimental results confirmed the proposed linear fusion method (-sum) to have the best performance among the linear fusion schemes available (SAR-CNN, IR-CNN, -sum, -sum, -sum, and Bayesian fusion).

These techniques typically extract image features using image processing models, which are heavily dependent on visual cues and can thus be inaccurate. To address these issues, we propose the use of a deep convolutional neural network, an improved LeNet-5 structure called ICChaNet with a deeper structure and more complex parameters. First, the algorithm for character extraction is implemented and used to generate character samples from IC component images. This process includes grayscaling, binarization, and contour extraction, applied to a set of IC component images to establish 53 categories of characters (letters and number with similar symbols removed). Three critical hyperparameters, including learning rate, pooling strategy, and optimization strategy, are then optimized through a comparative analysis. The effect of different network architectures on model efficiency is also investigated by varying the layer depth. A combination classifier strategy is subsequently added to the fully connected layers to strengthen the feature expression in the corresponding classes. Finally, the performance of the proposed ICChaNet model is verified through a comparison with popular CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that ICChaNet has achieved a classification accuracy of 98.5% and a test average accuracy precision of 97.73%. These results suggest the proposed ICChaNet model is a promising approach for automated character identification.","[Jia, Xiaojun; Liu, Zihao] Jiaxing Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Jiaxing, Peoples R China",,"Jia, XJ (corresponding author), Jiaxing Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Jiaxing, Peoples R China.",xjjiad@sina.com; lzh@zjxu.edu.cn,,,"Zhejiang Public Welfare Technology Research Project Fund of China [LGG20F010010, LGG21F030013]; City Public Welfare Technology Application Research Project of Jiaxing Science and Technology Bureau of China [2018AY11008, 2020AY10009]",Zhejiang Public Welfare Technology Research Project Fund of China; City Public Welfare Technology Application Research Project of Jiaxing Science and Technology Bureau of China,"This work was supported in part by the Zhejiang Public Welfare Technology Research Project Fund of China under Grant LGG20F010010, LGG21F030013, and the City Public Welfare Technology Application Research Project of Jiaxing Science and Technology Bureau of China under Grant 2018AY11008 and 2020AY10009.

This paper utilizes knowledge distillation through teacher-student paradigm (Hinton et al., 2015) in a novel setting that exploits the feature extraction capability of DNNs for higher-accuracy quantization. As such, our algorithm logically divides a pretrained full-precision DNN to multiple sections, each of which exposes intermediate features to train a team of students independently in the quantized domain. This divide and conquer strategy, makes the training of each student section possible in isolation, which offers additional speedup through enabling parallelization, while all these independently trained sections are later stitched together to form the equivalent fully quantized network. Experiments on various DNNs (AlexNet, LeNet, MobileNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-20, SVHN and VGG-11) show that, this approach-called DCQ (Divide and Conquer Quantization)-on average, improves the performance of a state-of-the-art quantized training technique, DoReFa-Net (Zhou et al., 2016) by 21.6% and 9.3% for binary and ternary quantization, respectively. Additionally, we show that incorporating DCQ to existing quantized training methods leads to improved accuracies as compared to previously reported by multiple state-of-the-art quantized training methods.","[Elthakeb, Ahmed T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Pilligundla, Prannoy; Mireshghallah, Fatemehsadat; Esmaeilzadeh, Hadi] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Cloninger, Alexander] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Math, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",,"Elthakeb, AT (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",elthakeb@ucsd.com,,"Cloninger, Alexander/0000-0002-1423-9624","National Science Foundation (NSF) [1703812, 1609823, 1553192, 2012266, 1819222]; Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) [2019-SD-2884]; Russel Sage Foundation award [2196]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Young Investigator Program (YIP) award [FA9550-17-1-0274]; National Institute of Health (NIH) award [R01EB028350]; Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL); Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) [FA8650-20-2-7009, HR0011-18-C-0020]",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC); Russel Sage Foundation award; Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Young Investigator Program (YIP) award(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); National Institute of Health (NIH) award(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)(United States Department of DefenseUS Air Force Research Laboratory); Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA)(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)),"This work was in part supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) awards CN#1703812, ECCS#1609823, CCF#1553192, DMS#2012266, DMS#1819222, Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) contract #2019-SD-2884, Russel Sage Foundation award #2196, Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Young Investigator Program (YIP) award #FA9550-17-1-0274, National Institute of Health (NIH) award #R01EB028350, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) under agreement number #FA8650-20-2-7009 and #HR0011-18-C-0020, and gifts from Microsoft, Google, Qualcomm, Xilinx.

Disability can be prevented by early detection of lesions. Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), can learn patterns on brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) so as to predict the conversion of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) to definite multiple sclerosis. The aim of this paper is to develop a method to automatically detect the conversion. The proposed algorithm is an improved CNN which uses LeNet architecture coding in Python and Keras library. It consists of different convolutional layers which learn the patterns of input images by using convolutional filters. ReLU activation function and max-pooling are used to reduce the dimensions of images for efficient and fast processing. A detailed investigation of automatic prediction algorithm is performed on the MRI images of 21 patients. The 21 patients were scanned at onset of CIS and a year later (of whom, 11 converted to MS and 10 did not convert to MS). The proposed deep learning algorithm predicted the presence of MS with an accuracy of 83.3% and 100% in two experiments. In the first experiment, 5 out of 6 patients were predicted correctly. In the second experiment, 6 out of 6 patients were predicted correctly. The experiments have proved that the proposed method is an automated system which can predict the disease accurately and quickly, contributing to the prevention and alleviation of the disability caused by the disease.","[Afzal, H.

Unfortunately, manual diagnosis suffers from its lengthy process, as well as elevated cost. With this type of cancerous disease, early detection will increase the chances of suitable medical procedures leading to either a full recovery or the prolongation of the patient's life. This has increased the efforts to automate the detection and diagnosis process without human intervention, allowing the detection of multiple types of tumors from MR images. This research paper proposes a multi-class Glioma tumor classification technique using the proposed deep-learning-based features with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. A deep convolution neural network is used to extract features of the MR images, which are then fed to an SVM classifier. With the proposed technique, a 96.19% accuracy was achieved for the HGG Glioma type while considering the FLAIR modality and a 95.46% for the LGG Glioma tumor type while considering the T2 modality for the classification of four Glioma classes (Edema, Necrosis, Enhancing, and Non-enhancing). The accuracies achieved using the proposed method were higher than those reported by similar methods in the extant literature using the same Bra TS dataset.

In this paper, a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model named multi-scale gated multi-head attention depthwise separable CNN (MGMADS-CNN) is proposed, which is based on attention mechanism and depthwise separable convolution. A multi-scale gated multi-head attention mechanism is designed to extract effective feature information from the COVID-19 X-ray and CT images for classification. Moreover, the depthwise separable convolution layers are adopted as MGMADS-CNN's backbone to reduce the model size and parameters. The LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet, VGGNet-16, and three MGMADS-CNN models are trained, validated and tested with tenfold cross-validation on X-ray and CT images. The results show that MGMADS-CNN with three attention layers (MGMADS-3) has achieved accuracy of 96.75% on X-ray images and 98.25% on CT images. The specificity and sensitivity are 98.06% and 96.6% on X-ray images, and 98.17% and 98.05% on CT images. The size of MGMADS-3 model is only 43.6 M bytes. In addition, the detection speed of MGMADS-3 on X-ray images and CT images are 6.09 ms and 4.23 ms for per image, respectively. It is proved that the MGMADS-3 can detect and classify COVID-19 faster with higher accuracy and efficiency.","[Hong, Geng; Chen, Xiaoyan; Chen, Jianyong; Zhang, Miao; Ren, Yumeng; Zhang, Xinyu] Tianjin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Informat & Automat, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China",,"Chen, XY (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Informat & Automat, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China.",cxywxr@tust.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61903724]; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin [18YFZCGX00360],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin(Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin),This work was supported by The National Natural Science Foundation of China under the Grant Number 61903724 and by The Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin under Grant Number 18YFZCGX00360.,,31,2,2,4,14,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,SEP 10,2021.0,11,1,,,,,,,18048,10.1038/s41598-021-97428-8,0.0,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,UO7IY,34508120.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000694868000019,0

Although, there is enormous progress made in terms of algorithm performance, the security aspect of these algorithms has not received a lot of attention from the research community. As more industries start to adopt these algorithms the issue of security is becoming even more relevant. Security vulnerabilities in machine learning (ML), especially in deep neural networks (DNN), is becoming a concern. Various techniques have been proposed, including data manipulations and model stealing. However, most of them are focused on ML algorithms and target threat models that require access to training dataset. In this paper, we present a methodology that analyzes the DNN weight parameters under the threat model that assumes the attacker has the access to the weight memory only. This analysis is then used to develop an attack that manipulates weight parameters with respect to their sensitivity. To evaluate this attack, we implemented our methodology on a MLP trained on IRIS dataset and LeNet (DNN architecture) trained on MNIST dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that alteration of model parameters results in subtle accuracy drop of the model. Depending on the applications such subtle changes can cause significant system malfunction or disruption, for example in vision-based industrial applications. Our results show that using our methodology a subtle accuracy drop can be achieved in a reasonable amount of time with very few parameter changes.","[Hailesellasie, Muluken; Nelson, Jacob; Hasan, Syed Rafay] Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA; [Khalid, Faiq] Vienna Univ Technol, TU Wien, Inst Comp Engn, Vienna, Austria",,"Hailesellasie, M (corresponding author), Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA.",mthailese142@students.tntech.edu; faiq.khalid@tuwien.ac.at; shasan@tntech.edu,,,National Science Foundation-NSF [CNS 1560434],National Science Foundation-NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work is partially supported by National Science Foundation-NSF CNS 1560434.,,20,4,4,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1548-3746,,978-1-7281-2788-0,MIDWEST SYMP CIRCUIT,,,2019.0,,,,,,,650,653,,,,,,4,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering,BP5LR,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000556188100153,0

Yet, DNNs suffer from several major challenges; in particular, in many applications where the input data is relatively sparse, DNNs face the problems of overfitting to the input data and poor generalizability. This brings up several critical questions: Are all inputs equally important? Can we selectively focus on parts of the input data in a way that reduces overfitting to irrelevant observations? Recently, attention networks showed some success in helping the overall process focus onto parts of the data that carry higher importance in the current context. Yet, we note that the current attention network design approaches are not sufficiently informed about the key data characteristics in identifying salient regions in the data. We propose an innovative robust feature learning framework, scale-invariant attention networks (SAN), that identifies salient regions in the input data for the CNN to focus on. Unlike the existing attention networks, SAN concentrates attention on parts of the data where there is major change across space and scale. We argue, and experimentally show, that the salient regions identified by SAN lead to better network performance compared to state-of-the-art (attentioned and non-attentioned) approaches, including architectures such as LeNet, VGG, ResNet, and LSTM, with common benchmark datasets, MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR10/20/100, GTSRB, ImageNet, Mocap, Aviage, and GTSDB for tasks such as image/time series classification, time series forecasting and object detection in images.","[Garg, Yash; Candan, K.

The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) has historically been influenced by medical ventilation on heart failure; nevertheless, the sleep snore analysis is the best model to diagnose. The problems with ventilation are caused by problems with air pressure and blood circulation in the heart valves, where the pathological measures are continually detecting ventilation issues. Understanding the pathophysiology of OSA will have a direct impact on clinical treatment choices as well as the design of clinical studies. Treatments could be tailored to each patient's unique needs based on the fundamental reason to their OSA. Through the OSA treatment, patients could feel better, and understanding OSA symptoms and also outcomes will improve patient's health; as a result, the study reveals that most of the population are likely to benefit from specific OSA treatment approaches. For achieving the benefits of OSA treatment the classification accuracy is needed to be improved. So, in this research work, an LeNet-100 CNN-based deep learning technology is used to get information and apply the classification approaches.

Pipelining results in the use of stale weights. Existing approaches to pipelined training avoid or limit the use of stale weights with techniques that either underutilize accelerators or increase training memory footprint. This paper contributes a pipelined backpropagation scheme that uses stale weights to maximize accelerator utilization and keep memory overhead modest. It explores the impact of stale weights on the statistical efficiency and performance using 4 CNNs (LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet) and shows that when pipelining is introduced in early layers, training with stale weights converges and results in models with comparable inference accuracies to those resulting from nonpipelined training (a drop in accuracy of 0.4%, 4%, 0.83%, and 1.45% for the 4 networks, respectively). However, when pipelining is deeper in the network, inference accuracies drop significantly (up to 12% for VGG and 8.5% for ResNet-20). The paper also contributes a hybrid training scheme that combines pipelined with nonpipelined training to address this drop. The potential for performance improvement of the proposed scheme is demonstrated with a proof-of-concept pipelined backpropagation implementation in PyTorch on 2 GPUs using ResNet-56/110/224/362, achieving speedups of up to 1.8X over a 1-GPU baseline.","[Zhang, Lifu; Abdelrahman, Tarek S.] Univ Toronto, Edward S Rogers Sr Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Abdelrahman, TS (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Edward S Rogers Sr Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada.",tsa@eceg.toronto.edu,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Huawei Research,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Huawei Research(Huawei Technologies),This research was supported by grants from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Huawei Research.,,44,0,0,1,5,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-9724,1687-9732,,APPL COMPUT INTELL S,Appl.

PAGE is easy to implement as it is designed via a small adjustment to vanilla SGD: in each iteration, PAGE uses the vanilla minibatch SGD update with probability p t or reuses the previous gradient with a small adjustment, at a much lower computational cost, with probability 1 - p(t). We give a simple formula for the optimal choice of p(t). Moreover, we prove the first tight lower bound Omega (n + root n/epsilon(2)), for non-convex finite-sum problems, which also leads to a tight lower bound Omega (b + root b/epsilon(2)) for non- convex online problems, where b := min{sigma(2)/epsilon(2), n} . Then, we show that PAGE obtains the optimal convergence results O(n + root n/epsilon(2)) (finite-sum) and O(b + root b/is an element of(2)) (online) matching our lower bounds for both nonconvex finite-sum and online problems. Besides, we also show that for nonconvex functions satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition, PAGE can automatically switch to a faster linear convergence rate O(. log 1/epsilon).

Because of the high maneuverability and practicality of this flying object, how we ensure it is used for benign purposes in urban life has become a major issue. Most such drones are small enough to avoid many current airborne detection methods and cheap enough to be disposable. We were able to gather enough amount of multimedia sources including drone-related sources using open online platforms, such as YouTube and other similar services. For a subset of commercial quadcopter drones, we collected sound sample data consisting of recordings and YouTube videos and built a trained simple nonlinear neural network filter to classify them. We used Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients to reduce the amount of data as the input signal and created two-dimensional spectrogram images to minimize the loss of temporal information in the sample, as suggested by previous research. Most of the acoustic signal energy in the drone sound existed in specific frequency bands and residual signal patterns were spread up to around 15 kHz. We designed and tested several recurrent and convolutional neural network models and one of the simple neural network models based on the LeNet architecture could classify over 10 different types of drones from acoustic data with over 97% accuracy including an additional path for the detection of general acoustic drone patterns.","[Yoo, Sinwoo; Ryu, Yeongbin; Shin, Sunghoon; Oh, Hyukjun] Kwangwoon Univ, Elect & Commun Engn, Seoul, South Korea",,"Oh, H (corresponding author), Kwangwoon Univ, Kwangwoon Ro 20, Seoul 01897, South Korea.",hj_oh@kw.ac.kr,"Shin, Sunghoon/O-4478-2014","Shin, Sunghoon/0000-0001-5355-2157; Yoo, Sinwoo/0000-0002-7425-3081",UAV Intelligence Systems Research Laboratory program of Defense Acquisition Program Administration and Agency for Defense Development [UD200027ED],UAV Intelligence Systems Research Laboratory program of Defense Acquisition Program Administration and Agency for Defense Development,This work has been supported by the UAV Intelligence Systems Research Laboratory program of Defense Acquisition Program Administration and Agency for Defense Development.

This results in expensive computation overheads during training. Consequently, most deep learning accelerators today employ pretrained weights and focus only on improving the design of the inference phase. The recent trend is to build a complete deep learning accelerator by incorporating the training module. Such efforts require an ultra-fast chip architecture for executing the BP algorithm. In this article, we propose a novel photonics-based backpropagation accelerator for high-performance deep learning training. We present the design for a convolutional neural network (CNN), BPLight-CNN, which incorporates the silicon photonics-based backpropagation accelerator. BPLight-CNN is a first-of-its-kind photonic and memristor-based CNN architecture for end-to-end training and prediction. We evaluate BPLight-CNN using a photonic CAD framework (IPKISS) on deep learning benchmark models, including LeNet and VGG-Net. The proposed design achieves (i) at least 34x speedup, 34x improvement in computational efficiency, and 38.5x energy savings during training; and (ii) 29x speedup, 31x improvement in computational efficiency, and 38.7x improvement in energy savings during inference compared with the state-of-the-art designs. All of these comparisons are done at a 16-bit resolution, and BPLight-CNN achieves these improvements at a cost of approximately 6% lower accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art.","[Dang, Dharanidhar; Sahoo, Debashis] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Chittamuru, Sai Vineel Reddy] Micron Technol Inc, 101 W Louis Henna Blvd, Austin, TX 78728 USA; [Pasricha, Sudeep] Colorado State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1373 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Mahapatra, Rabi] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, 400 Bizzell St, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,"Dang, D (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",dhdang@health.ucsd.edu; schittamuru@micron.com; sudeep@colostate.edu; rabi@tamu.edu; dsahoo@health.ucsd.edu,,"Dang, Dharanidhar/0000-0002-3802-381X","American Association of Immunologists, Texas AM University; College of Engineering, Texas AM University","American Association of Immunologists, Texas AM University; College of Engineering, Texas AM University","This work was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the American Association of Immunologists, and a doctoral teaching fellowship from the College of Engineering, Texas A&M University.",,51,0,0,4,6,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1550-4832,1550-4840,,ACM J EMERG TECH COM,ACM J.

Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in classification that extracts low-to high-level features. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network to distinguish an Alzheimers brain from a normal, healthy brain. The importance of classifying this type of medical data lies in its potential to develop a predictive model or system in order to recognize the symptoms of Alzheimers disease when compared with normal subjects and to estimate the stages of the disease. Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as Alzheimers disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features. Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimers subjects from normal controls, where the accuracy of testing data reached 96.85%. This experiment suggests that the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. This approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to predict more complicated systems.","[Sarraf, Saman] McMaster Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Sarraf, Saman] Univ Toronto, Rotman Res Inst Baycrest, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tofighi, Ghassem] Ryerson Univ, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada",,"Sarraf, S (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.;Sarraf, S (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Rotman Res Inst Baycrest, Toronto, ON, Canada.",samansarraf@ieee.org; gtofighi@ryerson.ca,,"Sarraf, Saman/0000-0003-3314-4281",Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health) [U01 AG024904]; DOD ADNI (Department of Defense) [W81XWH-12-2-0012]; National Institute on Aging; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; Canadian Institutes of Health Research,Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); DOD ADNI (Department of Defense); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB)); Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"Data collection and sharing for this project was funded by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health Grant U01 AG024904) and DOD ADNI (Department of Defense award number W81XWH-12-2-0012).

Multipliers are key arithmetic units in many applications, such as deep neural networks (DNNs) and digital signal processing (DSP) systems. In this article, an open-source adaptable approximate multiplier design driven by input distribution and polarity is proposed to generate optimized approximate multipliers to trade off between the application-level performance and the hardware cost. The proposed method minimizes the average square of the absolute error of an approximate multiplier according to the probability distributions of operands extracted from the target application with consideration of input polarity, achieving low hardware cost and negligible application-level performance loss. The proposed method can generate unsigned multipliers (or signed multipliers) based on the Braun multiplier (or Baugh-Wooley multiplier). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, three different-scale quantized DNNs, including LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG16 with $8$ $\times$ $8$ unsigned multiplication and an adaptive least mean square (LMS)-based finite impulse response (FIR) filter with $16$ $\times$ $16$ fixed-point signed multiplication, are evaluated. In the DNN training process, a noise training technique is adopted to reduce the accuracy loss due to the approximation. When compared to the state-of-the-art approximate multipliers, the generated multipliers can achieve up to 26.4% and 27.1% product of power, delay, and area gains with negligible application-level performance loss in VGG16 and FIR applications, respectively.","[Li, Zhen; Zheng, Su; Zhang, Jide; Lu, Yao; Gao, Jingbo; Tao, Jun; Wang, Lingli] Fudan Univ, Sch Microelect, State Key Lab ASIC & Syst, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China",,"Wang, LL (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Microelect, State Key Lab ASIC & Syst, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.",llwang@fudan.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61971143, 62174035]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61971143 and Grant 62174035.

Typically, the training of DNNs in multi-GPU systems leverages a data-parallel model in which a DNN is replicated on every GPU, and each GPU performs Forward Propagation (FP), Backward Propagation (BP) and, Weight Update (WU). We analyze the WU stage that is composed of collective communication (e.g., allReduce, broadcast), which demands very efficient communication among the GPUs to avoid diminishing returns when scaling the number of GPUs in the system. To overcome this issue, different data transfer mechanisms and libraries have been introduced by NVIDIA, and adopted by high-level frameworks to train DNNs. In this work, we evaluate and compare the performance of peer-to-peer (P2P) data transfer method and NCCL library-based communication method for training DNNs on a DGX-1 system consisting of 8 NVIDIA Volta-based GPUs. We profile and analyze the training of five popular DNNs (GoogLeNet, AlexNet, Inception-v3, ResNet and LeNet) using 1, 2, 4 and 8 GPUs. We show the breakdown of the training time across the FP+BP stage and the WU stage to provide insights about the limiting factors of the training algorithm as well as to identify the bottlenecks in the multi-GPU system architecture.

In this paper, we propose Int-Monitor, a novel neural network model triggered hardware trojan in DNN accelerators. By implanting a well-designed interrupt monitor between the host processor and DNN accelerator, this backdoor can capture specific DNN models and trigger the trojan to attack DNN bias buffers. By attacking the global bias buffer, this trojan can prevent the activation of neurons in a DNN model. As result, the network forward propagation will be invalid and the accelerator will deny service. Runtime experiments on LeNet, Resnet, YOLOv2 and YOLOv4tiny DNN models show Int-Monitor can successfully attack the FPGA-based DNN accelerator SoCs. RTL synthesis and implementation show this trojan takes only small hardware overhead and negligible power consumption. It brings 0.5%, 0.2% hardware overhead and 0.622%, 0.187% power consumption on average in the SIMD and NVDLA accelerators.

However, little is known about its recruited cognitive mechanisms. Our investigation aims to explore the cognitive mechanisms underlying various types of pronoun resolution in Chinese using an electroencephalograph (EEG). We used three convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-LeNeT-5, GoogleNet, and EffifcientNet-to discover high-level feature abstractions of the EEG spatial topologies. The output of the three models was then fused using different scales by principal component analysis (PCA) to achieve cognitive workload classification. Overall, the workload classification rate by fusing three deep networks can be achieved at 55-63% in a participant-specific manner. We provide evidence that both the behavioral indicator of reaction time and the neural indicator of cognitive workload collected during pronoun resolution vary depending on the type of the pronoun. We observed an increase in reaction time accompanied by a decrease of the theta power while participants were processing ambiguous pronoun resolution compared to unambiguous controls. We propose that ambiguous pronoun resolution involves a more time-consuming yet more flexible cognitive mechanism, consistent with the predictions of the decision-making framework from an influential pragmatic tradition. Our results extend previous research that the cognitive states of resolving ambiguous and unambiguous pronouns are differentiated, indicating that cognitive workload evaluated using the method of machine learning for analysis of EEG signals acts as a complementary indicator for studying pronoun resolution and serves as an important inspiration for human-machine interaction.","[Zhao, Mengyuan] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Coll Foreign Languages, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China; [Ji, Zhangyifan; Zhang, Jing; Zhu, Yiwen; Ye, Chunhua; Wang, Guangying; Yin, Zhong] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Engn Res Ctr Opt Instrument & Syst, Shanghai Key Lab Modern Opt Syst, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China; [Yin, Zhong] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Sch Opt Elect & Comp Engn, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China",,"Yin, Z (corresponding author), Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Engn Res Ctr Opt Instrument & Syst, Shanghai Key Lab Modern Opt Syst, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China.;Yin, Z (corresponding author), Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Sch Opt Elect & Comp Engn, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R China.",mengyuan.zhao@usst.edu.cn; 202440428@st.usst.edu.cn; 202440470@st.usst.edu.cn; 202440468@st.usst.edu.cn; 192550424@st.usst.edu.cn; 192550434@st.usst.edu.cn; yinzhong@usst.edu.cn,,"Yin, Zhong/0000-0003-2013-4009",National Social Science Fund of China [18CZX014],National Social Science Fund of China,"This research was funded by The National Social Science Fund of China, grant number 18CZX014.",,55,0,0,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3425,,BRAIN SCI,Brain Sci.,MAR,2022.0,12,3,,,,,,,369,10.3390/brainsci12030369,0.0,,,23,Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,0D4JB,35326325.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000775962300001,0

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used to perform intelligent visual object recognition. Yet, CNNs still suffer from severe accuracy degradation, particularly on illumination-variant datasets. To address this problem, we propose a new CNN method based on orien-tation fusion for visual object recognition. The proposed cloud-based video analytics system pioneers the use of bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition to split a video frame into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). We further propose these IMFs to endure Reisz transform to produce monogenic object compo-nents, which are in turn used for the training of CNNs. Past works have demonstrated how the object orientation component may be used to pursue accuracy levels as high as 93%. Herein we demonstrate how a feature-fusion strategy of the orientation components leads to further improving visual recogni-tion accuracy to 97%. We also assess the scalability of our method, looking at both the number and the size of the video streams under scrutiny. We carry out extensive experimentation on the publicly avail-able Yale dataset, including also a self generated video datasets, finding significant improvements (both in accuracy and scale), in comparison to AlexNet, LeNet and SE-ResNeXt, which are three most commonly used deep learning models for visual object recognition and classification.

This paper utilizes knowledge distillation through teacher-student paradigm (Hinton et al., 2015) in a novel setting that exploits the feature extraction capability of DNNs for higher-accuracy quantization. As such, our algorithm logically divides a pretrained full-precision DNN to multiple sections, each of which exposes intermediate features to train a team of students independently in the quantized domain. This divide and conquer strategy, makes the training of each student section possible in isolation, which offers additional speedup through enabling parallelization, while all these independently trained sections are later stitched together to form the equivalent fully quantized network. Experiments on various DNNs (AlexNet, LeNet, MobileNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-20, SVHN and VGG-11) show that, this approach-called DCQ (Divide and Conquer Quantization)-on average, improves the performance of a state-of-the-art quantized training technique, DoReFa-Net (Zhou et al., 2016) by 21.6% and 9.3% for binary and ternary quantization, respectively. Additionally, we show that incorporating DCQ to existing quantized training methods leads to improved accuracies as compared to previously reported by multiple state-of-the-art quantized training methods.","[Elthakeb, Ahmed T.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Pilligundla, Prannoy; Mireshghallah, Fatemehsadat; Esmaeilzadeh, Hadi] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Cloninger, Alexander] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Math, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",,"Elthakeb, AT (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",elthakeb@ucsd.com,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF) [1703812, 1609823, 1553192, 2012266, 1819222]; Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) [2019-SD-2884]; Russel Sage Foundation award [2196]; Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Young Investigator Program (YIP) award [FA9550-17-1-0274]; National Institute of Health (NIH) award [R01EB028350]; Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL); Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) [FA8650-20-2-7009, HR0011-18-C-0020]",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC); Russel Sage Foundation award; Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Young Investigator Program (YIP) award(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); National Institute of Health (NIH) award(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)(United States Department of DefenseUS Air Force Research Laboratory); Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA)(United States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)),"This work was in part supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) awards CN#1703812, ECCS#1609823, CCF#1553192, DMS#2012266, DMS#1819222, Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) contract #2019-SD-2884, Russel Sage Foundation award #2196, Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Young Investigator Program (YIP) award #FA9550-17-1-0274, National Institute of Health (NIH) award #R01EB028350, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) under agreement number #FA8650-20-2-7009 and #HR0011-18-C-0020, and gifts from Microsoft, Google, Qualcomm, Xilinx.

However, the hand-crafted features used in these APPs usually lead to low recognition performance when used in a real environment. This is either because the target logo has less sharp edges and corner features which the hand-crafted schemes heavily depend on, or because some logos have larger intra-class variations and appear with different backgrounds. Some apps deal with this problem by just adding a button for the user to skip the phase of logo recognition. But this dramatically reduces the attractiveness of the apps as well as the advertisement effect. We promote an elegant solution to tackle the challenge of brand logo recognition. Thus, we propose a new CNN-based logo recognition scheme with a novel data enhancement strategy bias towards a single logo. We adapted the well-known CNN LeNet-5 to learn only two classes: the target logo and its best accompanying logo. Specifically, we utilized shape context as a measurement for characterizing the similarity between the target logo and other logos. Based on the similarity, the best accompanying dataset is generated for training the target logo. The experimental results show that the recall of our scheme surpasses hand-crafted feature based methods such as SIFT by 10% on real images while maintaining the same level of precision.","[Wang, Yulong; Yang, Wei; Zhang, Haoxin] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, 10 Xi Tu Cheng Rd, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China",,"Wang, YL (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, 10 Xi Tu Cheng Rd, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.",wyl@bupt.edu.cn; wyang@bupt.edu.cn; csj@bupt.edu.cn,,,National High-tech R&D Program of China (863 Program) [2015AA017201]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016QY01W0200],National High-tech R&D Program of China (863 Program)(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China); National Key Research and Development Program of China,The work was supported in part by the National High-tech R&D Program of China (863 Program)(2015AA017201) and National Key Research and Development Program of China(2016QY01W0200).

Artificial intelligence allows for novel analysis of images. We hypothesized that a deep learning model can predict tumor response to NAC. Methods Patients with pancreatic cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy prior to pancreatoduodenectomy were identified between November 2009 and January 2018. The College of American Pathologists Tumor Regression Grades 0-2 were defined as pathologic response (PR) and grade 3 as no response (NR). Axial images from preoperative computed tomography scans were used to create a 5-layer convolutional neural network and LeNet deep learning model to predict PRs. The hybrid model incorporated decrease in carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) of 10%. Accuracy was determined by area under the curve. Results A total of 81 patients were included in the study. Patients were divided between PR (333 images) and NR (443 images). The pure model had an area under the curve (AUC) of .738 (P < .001), whereas the hybrid model had an AUC of .785 (P < .001). CA19-9 decrease alone was a poor predictor of response with an AUC of .564 (P = .096). Conclusions A deep learning model can predict pathologic tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and the model is improved with the incorporation of decreases in serum CA19-9. Further model development is needed before clinical application.","[Watson, Michael D.; Baimas-George, Maria R.; Murphy, Keith J.; Pickens, Ryan C.; Iannitti, David A.; Martinie, John B.; Baker, Erin H.; Vrochides, Dionisios; Ocuin, Lee M.] Atrium Hlth, Dept Surg, Div Hepatobiliary & Pancreat Surg, Charlotte, NC USA",,"Ocuin, LM (corresponding author), Atrium Hlth Cabarrus, Div Hepatobiliary & Pancreat Surg, 200 Med Pk Dr,Suite 430, Concord, NC 28025 USA.",lee.ocuin@atriumhealth.org,,,,,,,33,4,4,2,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1348,1555-9823,,AM SURGEON,Am.

Although a few ongoing studies still concern handcrafted features, most of the recent works focus on automatic feature extraction via CNN-based algorithms, which has achieved breakthrough results. However, benchmark databases for finger-vein identification have a limited sample size per individual, which makes it difficult for them to capture the best representations in an individuals finger vein. Additionally, with the rise of spoofing attacks, obtaining the best representation of the finger vein has become even more important. Even though these algorithms adapt transfer learning by using pre-trained ImageNet weights, which create a general image feature space, it may be not the most optimal space for finger-vein identification. From this point of view, this paper firstly aims to use Capsule Network to take advantage of using convolutions with a limited number of samples on four finger-vein benchmark sub-databases. Moreover, it aims to extract finger-vein features that are more definable and rationally augments without using any pre-trained weights. Secondly, it compares the CNN-based equivalent and LeNet-5 models to show how Capsule Network is better at approaching representing features. This capsule-based finger-vein identification approach using 32x32 image resolutions achieves an average 95.5% accuracy on four benchmark sub-databases.","[Gumusbas, Dilara; Yildirim, Tulay] Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Elect & Elect Engn, Istanbul, Turkey; [Kocakulak, Mustafa; Acir, Nurettin] Bursa Tech Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Bursa, Turkey",,"Gumusbas, D (corresponding author), Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Elect & Elect Engn, Istanbul, Turkey.",f0415058@std.yildiz.edu.tr; tulay@yildiz.edu.tr; mustafa.kocakulak@btu.edu.tr; nurettin.acir@btu.edu.tr,"; YILDIRIM, Tulay/A-6996-2018","Kocakulak, Mustafa/0000-0001-7036-1723; YILDIRIM, Tulay/0000-0001-9993-5583",,,,,13,4,4,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-2485-8,,,,2019.0,,,,,,,437,441,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BP5GE,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000555467200063,0

Method: We used 72 3D head volumes of infants with normal (13), DPB (34), and craniosynostosis (25). These volumes contain only information about the head shape and lack texture. From these 3D volumes, top-view 2D renderings were generated from different viewing angles. We generated 37 2D files were generated from each 3D volume, and we applied additional data augmentation to obtain a total of 5,254 2D images. We then used this dataset to investigate the performance of a well-known deep learning architectures for image classification, i.e., LeNet. The data were divided into training and test sets (85% and 15%, respectively with minimum one data of each class in the test set). We performed model evaluation by cross-validation. Results: The overall accuracy of the cranial shape analysis model was 87.5 +/- 5.59%. Cases with craniosynostosis were identified with 0.99 +/- 0.01 accuracy, while subjects with DPB were identified with 0.78 +/- 0.1. The accuracy of the model to identify normal cases without cranial deformation was 0.96 +/- 0.04. Conclusions: Deep learning-based methods can be used for the accurate detection, and classification of different types of conditions with head malformation using 2D photographic data. These algorithms will be packaged as a mobile health solution to make a decision support tool available at the point-of-care.","[Yektaie, Mohammad Ali] Georgetown Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Ghasemi, Zahra; Hezaveh, S.

It has become one of the necessary detection parameters for manufacturers of thermal imaging cameras. The traditional subjective MRTD parameter test method is gradually replaced by objective test methods due to its long test time and high labor cost. At present, the objective test method has developed the video MTF method and the photometric camera method, but both methods have their corresponding limitations. This paper proposes a new objective MRTD parameter test method based on CNN neural network. Firstly, the four-bar target image used to test the MRTD parameters is analyzed. It is concluded that the process of testing the MRTD parameters is essentially an image classification, which lays a foundation for the learning of CNN neural networks. Then the network model of CNN neural network interpretation of four-bar target image is expounded, and the accuracy of MRTD test results under different network models is analyzed. It was found that the network structure should not be complicated in the classification process of the four-bar target image. Based on the classic CNN neural network LeNet model, this paper proposes a CNN neural network suitable for four-bar target image classification problem by optimizing the convolution layer size, changing the activation function and adjusting the network structure. The experimental results show that the optimized CNN neural network improves the accuracy and repeatability of the MRTD parameter test.","[Rong, Weigang; Zhang, Wenwen; He, Weiji; Chen, Qian; Gu, Guohua] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Optoelect Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Tiekun; Qiu, Zhi] Xian Sicong Chuangwei Optoelect Co Ltd, Xian, Peoples R China",,"Rong, WG (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Optoelect Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",rwg_njust@163.com,"陈, 钱/S-9759-2018","Chen, Qian/0000-0002-1909-302X",,,,,6,1,1,0,1,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,978-1-5106-3657-6,PROC SPIE,,,2020.0,11439,,,,,,,,1143910,10.1117/12.2544098,0.0,,,7,Instruments & Instrumentation; Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Instruments & Instrumentation; Optics,BP5WF,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000558337500034,0

The recognition rates of handwritten basic characters and numerals are very high. However, the recognition rates of compound characters and modifiers are still poor. This might be due to their large class size with huge writing styles, much similarity, and unavailability of sufficient data for deep learning. In fact, there are some compound characters which appear very rare in practice. A proper selection of frequently used characters may reduce class size, and hence improving the accuracy. In this study, we performed a statistics on the frequency of compound characters, we developed two datasets for modifiers and compound characters, and finally we proposed a heterogeneous deep learning model (RATNet) for characters recognition. A statistics was performed on two daily Bengali newspapers, and characters with frequency >= 5% were selected.

The classical English and digital characters based CAPTCHAs are recognized with high accuracy. Due to the complication of Chinese characters which greatly enhance the difficulty of automatic recognition, an increasing number of Chinese web sites use Chinese Character CAPTCHAs. To recognize Chinese Character CAPTCHAs, we propose a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based approach to learn strokes, radicals and character features of Chinese characters, and prove that our network structure is superior to LENET-5 in this task. Furthermore, we formulate the relation among accuracy, the number of training samples and iterations, which is used to estimate the performance of our approach. Firstly, this approach greatly improves the recognition accuracy of Chinese Character CAPTCHAs with distortion, rotation and background noise. Our experiments results show that this approach achieves over 95% accuracy for single Chinese character and 84% accuracy for three types of Chinese Character CAPTCHAs with four Chinese characters. Secondly, our experiment results and theoretical analysis show that the accuracy of recognition has the exponential relationship with the product of the number of training samples and iterations in the condition of enough and representative training samples.

The logarithmic multiplier (LM) converts multiplication into addition and has inherent approximate characteristics. In this article, dynamic range approximate LMs (DR-ALMs) for machine learning applications are proposed; they use Mitchell's approximation and a dynamic range operand truncation scheme. The worst case (absolute and relative) errors for the proposed DR-ALMs are analyzed. The accuracy and the hardware overhead of these designs are provided to select the best approximate scheme according to different metrics. The proposed DR-ALMs are compared with the conventional LM with exact operands and previous approximate multipliers; the results show that the power-delay product (PDP) of the best proposed DR-ALM (DR-ALM-6) are decreased by up to 54.07 percent with the mean relative error distance (MRED) decreasing by 21.30 percent compared with 16-bit conventional design. Case studies for three machine learning applications show the viability of the proposed DR-ALMs. Compared with the exact multiplier and its conventional counterpart, the back-propagation classifier with DR-ALMs with a truncation length larger than 4 has a similar classification result for the three datasets; the K-means clustering application with all DR-ALMs has a similar clustering result for four datasets; and the handwritten digit recognition application with DR-ALM-5 or DR-ALM-6 for LeNet-5 achieves similar or even slightly higher recognition rate.","[Yin, Peipei; Wang, Chenghua; Waris, Haroon; Liu, Weiqiang] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China; [Han, Yinhe] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Lombardi, Fabrizio] Northeastern Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA USA",,"Liu, WQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China.",ppyin@nuaa.edu.cn; chwang@nuaa.edu.cn; haroonwaris@nuaa.edu.cn; liuweigiang@nuaa.edu.cn; yinhes@ict.ac.cn; lombardi@ece.neu.edu,"WARIS, HAROON/AAB-9322-2021","WARIS, HAROON/0000-0003-4670-3919; Lombardi, Fabrizio/0000-0003-3152-3245; Liu, Weiqiang/0000-0001-8398-8648","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61871216, 61834006]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities China [NE2019102]; Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province [2018XYDXX-009]; USA National Science Foundation [1812467]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province; USA National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by Grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61871216 and 61834006), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities China (NE2019102), the Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province (2018XYDXX-009) and the USA National Science Foundation under Grant no. 1812467.",,44,8,8,1,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2377-3782,,,IEEE T SUST COMPUT,IEEE Trans.

However, the features undergo many nonlinear transformations while performing the convolutional operation and the traditional CNN models are insufficient in dealing with the correlation between images. In American Sign Language (ASL) recognition, J and Z with moving gestures bring recognition challenges. This paper proposes a novel Two-Stream Mixed (TSM) method with feature extraction and fusion operation to improve the correlation of feature expression between two time-consecutive images for the dynamic gestures. The proposed TSM-CNN system is composed of preprocessing, the TSM block, and CNN classifiers. Two consecutive images in the dynamic gesture are used as inputs of streams, and resizing, transformation, and augmentation are carried out in the preprocessing stage. The fusion feature map obtained by addition and concatenation in the TSM block is used as inputs of the classifiers. Finally, a classifier classifies images. The TSM-CNN model with the highest performance scores depending on three concatenation methods is selected as the definitive recognition model for ASL recognition. We design 4 CNN models with TSM: TSM-LeNet, TSM-AlexNet, TSM-ResNet18, and TSM-ResNet50. The experimental results show that the CNN models with the TSM are better than models without TSM. The TSM-ResNet50 has the best accuracy of 97.57% for MNIST and ASL datasets and is able to be applied to a RGB image sensing system for hearing-impaired people.","[Ma, Ying; Xu, Tianpei; Kim, Kangchul] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Yeosu 59626, South Korea",,"Kim, K (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Yeosu 59626, South Korea.",kkc@jnu.ac.kr,,,,,,,47,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,AUG,2022.0,22,16,,,,,,,5959,10.3390/s22165959,0.0,,,17,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,4A8XM,36015719.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000845376700001,0

To protect the weights from state errors, the existing methods rely on an error correction code (ECC) or parity, which can incur power/storage overhead. We propose a weight-bit inversion method that minimizes accuracy loss caused by state errors without using ECC or parity. First, the method applies weight-bit inversion for state elimination (WISE), which removes the most error-prone state from MLC NAND, thereby improving the error robustness and the most significant bit (MSB) page read speed. If the initial accuracy loss caused by the WISE is unacceptable, we apply weight-bit inversion for state error reduction (WISER), which reduces weight mapping to error-prone states with minimum changes in weight value. To further improve the read speed with minimum accuracy loss, we propose an adaptive weight-bit inversion scheme that selectively applies WISE or WISER to the unit of a weight group. The simulation results imply that after 16K program-erase cycles in NAND Flash, WISER reduces the CIFAR-100 accuracy loss by 1.33X for LeNet-5, 2.92X for VGG-16, and 2.74X for Resnet-20 compared with the existing methods. In addition, the adaptive inversion technique improves the read speed by 48.6% without accuracy loss, compared with the WISER-only scheme.","[Jang, Jaehun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Semicond & Display Engn, Suwon, South Korea; [Ko, Jong Hwan] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Informat & Commun Engn, Suwon, South Korea; [Jang, Jaehun] Memory Div, Samsung Elect, Hwaseong, South Korea",,"Ko, JH (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Informat & Commun Engn, Suwon, South Korea.",jhko@skku.edu,,,"Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) of Korea, under the National Research Foundation (NRF) [2019R1F1A1048115]; Institute of Information and Communica-tion Technology Planning Evaluation (IITP) grants [IITP-2019-0-00421]; Information Technology Re-search Center (ITRC) program [IITP-2021-0-02052]; ICT Creative Con-silience program [IITP-2020-0-01821]; Artificial Intelligence Inno-vation Hub program [IITP-2021-0-02068]","Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) of Korea, under the National Research Foundation (NRF); Institute of Information and Communica-tion Technology Planning Evaluation (IITP) grants; Information Technology Re-search Center (ITRC) program; ICT Creative Con-silience program; Artificial Intelligence Inno-vation Hub program","This research was supported by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) of Korea, under the National Research Foundation (NRF) grant (2019R1F1A1048115) and Institute of Information and Communica-tion Technology Planning Evaluation (IITP) grants for the AI Gradu-ate School program (IITP-2019-0-00421) , Information Technology Re-search Center (ITRC) program (IITP-2021-0-02052) , ICT Creative Con-silience program (IITP-2020-0-01821) , and Artificial Intelligence Inno-vation Hub program (IITP-2021-0-02068) .",,26,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1383-7621,1873-6165,,J SYST ARCHITECT,J.

Many emerging deep learning frameworks start running over Big Data stacks, such as Hadoop and Spark. With the convergence of HPC, Big Data, and Deep Learning, these DLoBD stacks are taking advantage of RDMA and multi-/many-core based CPUs/GPUs. Even though a lot of activities are happening in the field, there is a lack of systematic studies on analyzing the impact of RDMA-capable networks and CPU/GPU on DLoBD stacks. To fill this gap, we propose a systematical characterization methodology and conduct extensive performance evaluations on three representative DLoBD stacks (i.e., CaffeOnSpark, TensorFlowOnSpark, and BigDL) to expose the interesting trends regarding performance, scalability, accuracy, and resource utilization. Our observations show that RDMA-based design for DLoBD stacks can achieve up to 2.7x speedup compared to the IPoIB based scheme. The RDMA scheme can also scale better and utilize resources more efficiently than the IPoIB scheme over InfiniBand clusters. For most cases, GPU-based deep learning can outperform CPU-based designs, but not always. We see that for LeNet on MNIST, CPU + MKL can achieve better performance than GPU and GPU + cuDNN on 16 nodes. Through our evaluation, we see that there are large rooms to improve the designs of current generation DLoBD stacks further.","[Lu, Xiaoyi; Shi, Haiyang; Javed, M.

This method involves designing different quantization ranges according to the sign of the weights, which can provide a larger quantization-value range. Combined with the fine-grained and multi-scale global retraining method proposed in this paper, the accuracy loss of low-bit quantization can be effectively reduced. We also proposed a novel convolutional algorithm using shift operations to replace multiplication to help to deploy the GSNQ quantized models on FPGAs. Quantization comparison experiments performed on LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG-Net, ResNet, and GoogLeNet showed that GSNQ has higher accuracy than most existing methods and achieves lossless quantization (i.e., the accuracy of the quantized CNN model is higher than the baseline) at low-bit quantization in most cases. FPGA comparison experiments showed that our convolutional algorithm does not occupy on-chip DSPs, and it also has a low comprehensive occupancy in terms of on-chip LUTs and FFs, which can effectively improve the computational parallelism, and this proves that GSNQ has good hardware-adaptation capability.

There is a timely need to map the latest software DCNNs to application-specific hardware, in order to achieve orders of magnitude improvement in performance, energy efficiency and compactness. Stochastic Computing (SC), as a low-cost alternative to the conventional binary computing paradigm, has the potential to enable massively parallel and highly scalable hardware implementation of DCNNs. One major challenge in SC based DCNNs is designing accurate nonlinear activation functions, which have a significant impact on the network-level accuracy but cannot be implemented accurately by existing SC computing blocks. In this paper, we design and optimize SC based neurons, and we propose highly accurate activation designs for the three most frequently used activation functions in software DCNNs, i.e, hyperbolic tangent, logistic, and rectified linear units. Experimental results on LeNet-5 using MNIST dataset demonstrate that compared with a binary ASIC hardware DCNN, the DCNN with the proposed SC neurons can achieve up to 61X, 151X, and 2X improvement in terms of area, power, and energy, respectively, at the cost of small precision degradation. In addition, the SC approach achieves up to 21X and 41X of the area, 41X and 72X of the power, and 198200X and 96443X of the energy, compared with CPU and GPU approaches, respectively, while the error is increased by less than 3.07%.

Although the majority of the automated systems are implementing Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on the hardware with impressive accuracy, a significant amount of cost is associated with data movement in these platforms. Recent advancements in processing-in-memory (PIM), a non-von Neumann computing paradigm, have proven to be very effective in minimizing data communication overheads by performing computations within the memory chip. However, these devices are primarily designed as inference engines and therefore have not been adequately investigated for real-time learning capabilities for applications in changing environments. In this work, we introduce uPIM, a PIM architecture that supports a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based performance-aware online learning model for updating the weights with minimal overheads. Our hardware-software co-design approach exhibits superior performance and efficiency in real-time applications like Autonomous Navigation Systems (ANS) by leveraging massive data-level parallelism and ultra-low data movement latency. The evaluations are performed on multiple state-of-the-art deep learning networks like LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet18, 34, 50 on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset and the Belgium Traffic Sign Dataset (BTSD) with several data-precisions.

Even though the payload is designed for Earth observation and to capture man-made patterns on the ground as the main mission, a secondary mission is planned for the classification of wildfire images by the convolution neural network (CNN) approach. Therefore, KITSUNE will be the first CubeSat to employ CNN to classify wildfire images in LEO. In this study, a deep-learning approach is utilized onboard the satellite in order to reduce the downlink data by pre-processing instead of the traditional method of performing the image processing at the ground station. The pre-trained CNN models generated in Colab are saved in RPi CM3+, in which, an uplink command will execute the image classification algorithm and append the results on the captured image data. The on-ground testing indicated that it could achieve an overall accuracy of 98% and an F1 score of a 97% success rate in classifying the wildfire events running on the satellite system using the MiniVGGNet network. Meanwhile, the LeNet and ShallowNet models were also compared and implemented on the CubeSat with 95% and 92% F1 scores, respectively.

We present our case study on MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

However, the excessive dependence on the image sample database is unable to provide individualized diagnosis service for different population groups. To overcome this problem, a medical AI framework based on data width evolution and self-learning is put forward in this paper to provide skin disease medical service meeting the requirement of real time, extendibility and individualization. First, the wide collection of data in the close-loop information flow of user and remote medical data center is discussed. Next, a data set filter algorithm based on information entropy is given, to lighten the load of edge node and meanwhile improve the learning ability of remote cloud analysis model. In addition, the framework provides an external algorithm load module, which can be compatible with the application requirements according to the model selected. Three kinds of deep learning model, i.e., LeNet-5, AlexNet and VGG16, are loaded and compared, which have verified the universality of the algorithm load module.

However, as the size of datasets and the depth of neural network architectures continue to grow, it is imperative to design high-performance and energy-efficient computing hardware for training CNNs. In this paper, we consider the problem of designing specialized CPU-GPU based heterogeneous manycore systems for energy-efficient training of CNNs. It has already been shown that the typical on-chip communication infrastructures employed in conventional CPU-GPU based heterogeneous manycore platforms are unable to handle both CPU and GPU communication requirements efficiently. To address this issue, we first analyze the on-chip traffic patterns that arise from the computational processes associated with training two deep CNN architectures, namely, LeNet and CDBNet, to perform image classification. By leveraging this knowledge, we design a hybrid Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture, which consists of both wireline and wireless links, to improve the performance of CPU-GPU based heterogeneous manycore platforms running the above-mentioned CNN training workloads. The proposed NoC achieves 1.8x reduction in network latency and improves the network throughput by a factor of 2.2 for training CNNs, when compared to a highly-optimized wireline mesh NoC. For the considered CNN workloads, these network-level improvements translate into 25 percent savings in full-system energy-delay-product (EDP). This demonstrates that the proposed hybrid NoC for heterogeneous manycore architectures is capable of significantly accelerating training of CNNs while remaining energy-efficient.","[Choi, Wonje; Duraisamy, Karthi; Doppa, Janardhan Rao; Pande, Partha Pratim] Washington State Univ, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Kim, Ryan Gary; Marculescu, Diana; Marculescu, Radu] Carnegie Mellon Univ, ECE, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",,"Pande, PP (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",wchoi1@eecs.wsu.edu; kduraisa@eecs.wsu.edu; rgkim@cmu.edu; jana@eecs.wsu.edu; pande@eecs.wsu.edu; dianam@cmu.edu; radum@cmu.edu,"Marculescu, Radu/AAR-5320-2021; Kim, Ryan/T-9499-2019; Marculescu, Diana/Q-4925-2019","Marculescu, Diana/0000-0002-5734-4221; Kim, Ryan/0000-0001-9249-3292",,,,,49,45,45,1,21,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",0018-9340,1557-9956,,IEEE T COMPUT,IEEE Trans.

They include text detection and character recognition in which characters are described then classified. In the classification step, characters are identified according to their features or template descriptions. Then, a given classifier is employed to identify characters. In this context, we have proposed the unified character descriptor (UCD) to represent characters based on their features. Then, matching was employed to ensure the classification. This recognition scheme performs a good OCR Accuracy on homogeneous scanned documents, however it cannot discriminate characters with high font variation and distortion.(3) To improve recognition, classifiers based on neural networks can be used. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) ensures high recognition accuracy when performing a robust training. Moreover, the convolutional neural network (CNN), is gaining nowadays a lot of popularity for its high performance. Furthermore, both CNN and MLP may suffer from the large amount of computation in the training phase. In this paper, we establish a comparison between MLP and CNN. We provide MLP with the UCD descriptor and the appropriate network configuration. For CNN, we employ the convolutional network designed for handwritten and machine-printed character recognition (Lenet-5) and we adapt it to support 62 classes, including both digits and characters. In addition, GPU parallelization is studied to speed up both of MLP and CNN classifiers.

In this paper, we aim to breakdown CNNs and analyze each layer independently and quantify their impact on memory footprint, power consumption, and latency. We analyze these properties of four common Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures: LeNet, AlexNet, VGG-11, and VGG-16. We optimize and implement each network on a low power computing platform suitable for constrained environments. Networks are validated using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. We show that modifying specific network design parameters such as filter size, the number of fully connected layers, and subsampling techniques have a considerable impact on the overall performance and efficiency, enabling informed trade-offs and optimization. We demonstrate up to 11x reduction in power consumption compared to another FPGA platform with 96x more memory capacity, while maintaining the state-of-art classification accuracy.","[Laguduva, Vishalini R.; Mahmud, Shakil; Karam, Robert; Katkoori, Srinivas] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Aakur, Sathyanarayanan N.] Oklahoma State Univ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",,"Laguduva, VR (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",vishalini@mail.usf.edu; shakilmahmud@mail.usf.edu; saakurn@okstate.edu; rkaram@mail.usf.edu; katkoori@mail.usf.edu,,"Aakur Narasimhan, Sathyanarayan/0000-0003-1062-8929",,,,,19,3,3,1,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1063-9667,,978-1-7281-5701-6,I CONF VLSI DESIGN,,,2020.0,,,,,,,149,154,,10.1109/VLSID49098.2020.00043,0.0,,,6,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering,BQ4GK,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000589612200026,0

The face video retrieval task is to find the videos containing the face of a specific person from a database with a face image or a face video of the same person as a query. A key challenge is to extract discriminative features with small storage space from face videos with large intra-class variations caused by different angle, illumination, and facial expression. In recent years, the CNN-based binary hashing and metric learning methods showed notable progress in image/video retrieval tasks. However, the existing CNN-based binary hashing and metric learning have limitations in terms of inevitable information loss and storage inefficiency, respectively. To cope with these problems, the proposed framework consists of two parts: first, a novel loss function using a radial basis function kernel (RBF Loss) is introduced to train a neural network to generate compact and discriminative high-level features, and secondly, an optimized quantization using a logistic function (Logistic Quantization) is suggested to convert a real-valued feature to a 1-byte integer with the minimum information loss. Through the face video retrieval experiments on a challenging TV series data set (ICT-TV), it is demonstrated that the proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art feature extraction methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness of RBF loss was also demonstrated through the image classification and retrieval experiments on the CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST data sets with LeNet-5.","[Choi, Young Rok; Kil, Rhee Man] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Appl Data Sci, Suwon 16419, South Korea",,"Kil, RM (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Appl Data Sci, Suwon 16419, South Korea.",dev.yrchoi@gmail.com; rmkil@skku.edu,,"Kil, Rhee Man/0000-0002-5829-3016","Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT) [2016-0-00133, 2019-0-00421]",Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) - Korea government (MSIT),"This work was partly supported by the Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2016-0-00133, Research on edge computing via collective intelligence of hyperconnection IoT nodes and No. 2019-0-00421, AI Graduate School Support Program (Sungkyunkwan University)).",,36,4,4,0,17,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1057-7149,1941-0042,,IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS,IEEE Trans.

The blasting signals must be separated from the microseismic signals in order to extract the information needed for the correct location of the source and for determining the blast mechanism. The use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a viable approach to extract these blast characteristic parameters automatically and to achieve the accuracy needed in the signal recognition. The Stockwell Transform (or S-Transform) has excellent two-dimensional time-frequency characteristics and thus to obtain the microseismic signal and blasting vibration signal separately, the microseismic signal has been converted in this work into a two-dimensional image format by use of the S-Transform, following which it is recognized by using the CNN. The sample data given in this paper are used for model training, where the training sample is an image containing three RGB color channels. The training time can be decreased by means of reducing the picture size and thus reducing the number of training steps used. The optimal combination of parameters can then be obtained after continuously updating the training parameters. When the image size is 180 x 140 pixels, it has been shown that the test accuracy can reach 96.15% and that it is feasible to classify separately the blasting signal and the microseismic signal based on using the S-Transform and the CNN model architecture, where the training parameters were designed by synthesizing LeNet-5 and AlexNet.","[Song, Guangdong; Grattan, Kenneth T.

However, it is challenging to achieve high-precision computations based on RRAM due to the limits of the resistance level and the interfaces. Low bit-width convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide promising solutions to introduce low bit-width RRAM devices and low bit-width interfaces in RRAM-based computing system (RCS). While open questions still remain regarding: 1) how to make matrix splitting when a single crossbar is not large enough to hold all parameters of one weight matrix; 2) how to design a pipeline to accelerate the inference based on line buffer structure; and 3) how to reduce the accuracy drop due to the parameter splitting and data quantization. In this paper, we propose an RRAM crossbar-based low bit-width CNN (LB-CNN) accelerator. We make detailed discussion on the system design, including the matrix splitting strategies to enhance the scalability, and the pipelined implementation based on line buffers to accelerate the inference. In addition, we propose a splitting and quantizing while training method to incorporate the actual hardware constraints with the training. In our experiments, low bit-width LeNet-5 on RRAM show much better robustness than multibit models with device variation. The pipeline strategy achieves approximately 6.0x speedup to process each image on ResNet-18. For low-bit VGG-8 on CIFAR-10, the proposed accelerator saves 54.9% of the energy consumption and 48.3% of the area compared with the multibit VGG-8 structure.","[Cai, Yi; Li, Boxun; Wang, Yu; Yang, Huazhong] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Innovat Ctr Future Chips, Beijing Natl Res Ctr Informat Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Tang, Tianqi] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Xia, Lixue] Alibaba Grp Beijing, Dept Cloud Intelligence, Beijing 100022, Peoples R China",,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Innovat Ctr Future Chips, Beijing Natl Res Ctr Informat Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",yu-wang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"WANG, Yu/B-7985-2011","WANG, Yu/0000-0001-6108-5157; Tang, Tianqi/0000-0001-8255-985X; Yang, Huazhong/0000-0003-2421-353X; Xia, Lixue/0000-0002-7731-7028; Cai, Yi/0000-0001-8264-3357","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0207600]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61832007, 61622403, 61621091]; Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology,"This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFA0207600, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61832007, Grant 61622403, and Grant 61621091, and in part by the Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology.

Furthermore, it has raised new challenges for monitoring the coastlines. Historically, satellite remote-sensing has been used for Sargassum monitoring in the ocean; nonetheless, limitations in the temporal and spatial resolution of available satellite platforms do not allow for near real-time monitoring of this macro-algae on beaches. This study proposes an innovative approach for monitoring Sargassum on beaches using Crowdsourcing for imagery collection, deep learning for automatic classification, and geographic information systems for visualizing the results. We have coined this collaborative process Collective View. It offers a geotagged dataset of images illustrating the presence or absence of Sargassum on beaches located along the northern and eastern regions in the Yucatan Peninsula, in Mexico. This new dataset is the largest of its kind in surrounding areas. As part of the design process for Collective View, three convolutional neural networks (LeNet-5, AlexNet and VGG16) were modified and retrained to classify images, according to the presence or absence of Sargassum. Findings from this study revealed that AlexNet demonstrated the best performance, achieving a maximum recall of 94%. These results are good considering that the training was carried out using a relatively small set of unbalanced images. Finally, this study provides a first approach to mapping the Sargassum distribution along the beaches using the classified geotagged images and offers novel insight into how we can accurately map the arrival of algal blooms along the coastline.","[Arellano-Verdejo, Javier] Colegio Frontera Sur, Dept Observat & Study Earth Atmosphere & Ocean, Chetmal, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Lazcano-Hernandez, Hugo E.] Colegio Frontera Sur, Catedras CONACYT, Chetmal, Quintana Roo, Mexico",,"Arellano-Verdejo, J (corresponding author), Colegio Frontera Sur, Dept Observat & Study Earth Atmosphere & Ocean, Chetmal, Quintana Roo, Mexico.;Lazcano-Hernandez, HE (corresponding author), Colegio Frontera Sur, Catedras CONACYT, Chetmal, Quintana Roo, Mexico.",javier.arellano@mail.ecosur.mx; hlazcanoh@ecosur.mx,,,,,,,34,5,5,4,11,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",,2376-5992,,PEERJ COMPUT SCI,PeerJ Comput.

Research on unconstrained handwritten recognition in some languages has achieved attractive advancement, but it lags behind for Bengali even though it is the major language spoken by about 230 million people in the Indian subcontinent, and even the first and official language of Bangladesh. Recently, the use of convolutional neural network (CNN) has been reported with high accuracy in pattern recognition and computer vision problems. The main purpose of this study is to provide an architecture of a CNN to improve the accuracy of handwritten Bengali numerals recognition (HBNR) and compare its performance with the existing ones. We proposed a new CNN architecture, VGG-11M, which improves an existing one (VGG-11). The normalized and rescaled images of each numeral were augmented by different transformation operations to increase the training samples and to add diversity in the dataset. Then, the images were used to train the proposed VGG-11M model. The recognition accuracy of the developed system was tested on both training and test sets of three publicly available handwritten Bengali numerals database at different resolutions. Finally the performance of the model was compared with four other architectures (LeNet-5, ResNet-50, VGG-11, and VGG-16). The highest accuracy 99.80%, 99.66%, and 99.25% was obtained using the proposed architecture on the test set of ISI, CMATERDB, and NUMTADB dataset, respectively, at resolution 32 x 32.

An improved traffic sign detection and recognition algorithm for intelligent vehicles is proposed to address problems such as how easily affected traditional traffic sign detection is by the environment, and poor real-time performance of deep learning-based methodologies for traffic sign recognition. Firstly, the HSV color space is used for spatial threshold segmentation, and traffic signs are effectively detected based on the shape features. Secondly, the model is considerably improved on the basis of the classical LeNet-5 convolutional neural network model by using Gabor kernel as the initial convolutional kernel, adding the batch normalization processing after the pooling layer and selecting Adam method as the optimizer algorithm. Finally, the traffic sign classification and recognition experiments are conducted based on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. The favorable prediction and accurate recognition of traffic signs are achieved through the continuous training and testing of the network model. Experimental results show that the accurate recognition rate of traffic signs reaches 99.75%, and the average processing time per frame is 5.4 ms. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm has remarkable accuracy and real-time performance, strong generalization ability and high training efficiency. The accurate recognition rate and average processing time are markedly improved.

We have also compared the performance against previously reported ONNs, the GridNet and ComplexNet, and a Quantum Optical Neural Network (QONN) that we built by combining the ComplexNet with quantum-inspired sinusoidal nonlinearities. Our work extends the prior research on QONN by adding quantum convolution and pooling layers. We have evaluated the models using the metrics of accuracies, confusion matrices, Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, and Matthews Correlation Coefficients. The performance of the models were similar, and the metrics indicated that the new QOCNN model is robust. Finally, we estimated the gains in computational efficiencies from executing this novel framework on a quantum computer, concluding that switching to a quantum computing based approach to deep learning may result in comparable accuracies to classical models while simultaneously achieving unprecedented boosts in computational performances and power allocation.","[Parthasarathy, Rishab; Bhowmik, Rohan T.] Harker Sch, San Jose, CA 95129 USA",,"Parthasarathy, R (corresponding author), Harker Sch, San Jose, CA 95129 USA.",rishabparthasarathy@gmail.com,"Parthasarathy, Rishab/ABB-5494-2021","Parthasarathy, Rishab/0000-0002-8982-9469; Bhowmik, Rohan/0000-0002-3556-4370",,,,,28,4,4,6,20,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021.0,9,,,,,,103337,103346,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3098775,0.0,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,TQ5GY,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000678309800001,0

Welding electrodes are subjected to different environmental and operational loading conditions during use. When they are replaced with a fixed interval, replacement may occur too early (raising maintenance costs) or too late (leading to quality issues). This motivates condition monitoring strategies for resistance spot welding electrode tips. Thus, this paper proposes a modified recurrence plot (RP) for robust condition monitoring of welding electrode tips in resistance spot welding systems. The overall procedure for the proposed condition monitoring approach consists of three steps: (1) transformation of a one-dimensional signal to a two-dimensional image, (2) unsupervised feature extraction with LeNet architecture-based convolutional neural networks, and (3) health indicator calculation. RP methods convert dynamic resistance waveforms to RPs. The original RP method provides an image with binary-colored pixels (i.e., black or white) that makes this method insensitive to the change of the waveform signal. The proposed RP method is devised to be sensitive to the change of the waveform signal, while enhancing robustness to external noise. The performance of the proposed RP method is evaluated by examining simulated aperiodic waveform signals with and without external noise. A case study is presented to examine the proposed method's ability to monitor the condition of resistance spot welding electrodes. The results show that the proposed method outperforms handcrafted, feature-based condition monitoring methods.

Rice mapping in Southern China, however, is very difficult as rice paddies are patchy and fragmented, reflecting the undulating and varied topography. In addition, abandoned lands widely exist in Southern China due to rapid urbanization. Abandoned lands are easily confused with paddy fields, thereby degrading the classification accuracy of rice paddies in such complex landscape regions. To address this problem, the present study proposes an innovative method for rice mapping through combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) model and a decision tree (DT) method with phenological metrics. First, a pre-trained LeNet-5 Model using the UC Merced Dataset was developed to classify the cropland class from other land cover types, i.e. built-up, rivers, forests. Then, paddy rice field was separated from abandoned land in the cropland class using a DT model with phenological metrics derived from the time-series data of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The accuracy of the proposed classification methods was compared with three other classification techniques, namely, back propagation neural network (BPNN), original CNN, pre-trained CNN applied to HJ-1 A/B charge-coupled device (CCD) images of Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, China. Results suggest that the proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 93.56%, much higher than those of other methods. This indicates that the proposed method can efficiently accommodate the challenges of rice mapping in regions with complex landscapes.","[Zhao, Shuang; Wu, Changshan] Tianjin Chengjian Univ, Sch Geol & Geomet, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiangnan; Wu, Ling] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Informat Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ding, Chao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shuyuan] Esri China Informat Technol Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Changshan] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",,"Liu, XN (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Informat Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liuxn@cugb.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Science Foundation Project [41701387],National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Science Foundation Project,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Science Foundation Project [Grant No. 41701387].,,60,18,18,6,69,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1548-1603,1943-7226,,GISCI REMOTE SENS,GISci.

This study explored existing technologies for diagnosing BC, such as mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) and summarized the disadvantages of the existing cancer diagnosis. The purpose of this article is to use gene expression profiles of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to classify BC samples and normal samples. The method proposed in this article triumphs over some of the shortcomings of traditional diagnostic methods and can conduct BC diagnosis more rapidly with high sensitivity and have no radiation. This study first selected the genes most relevant to cancer through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and differential expression analysis (DEA). Then it used the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to screen 23 hub genes. Finally, it used the support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), Bayesian network (BN), artificial neural network (ANN), convolutional neural network CNN-LeNet and CNN-AlexNet to process the expression levels of 23 hub genes. For gene expression profiles, the ANN model has the best performance in the classification of cancer samples. The ten-time average accuracy is 97.36% (+/- 0.34%), the F1 value is 0.8535 (+/- 0.0260), the sensitivity is 98.32% (+/- 0.32%), the specificity is 89.59% (+/- 3.53%) and the AUC is 0.99. In summary, this method effectively classifies cancer samples and normal samples and provides reasonable new ideas for the early diagnosis of cancer in the future.","[Jia, Dongfang; Chen, Cheng; Chen, Chen; Chen, Fangfang; Zhang, Ningrui; Yan, Ziwei; Lv, Xiaoyi] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Lv, Xiaoyi] Xinjiang Univ, Key Lab Signal Detect & Proc, Urumqi, Peoples R China",,"Lv, XY (corresponding author), Xinjiang Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Urumqi, Peoples R China.;Lv, XY (corresponding author), Xinjiang Univ, Key Lab Signal Detect & Proc, Urumqi, Peoples R China.",xjuwawj01@163.com,,,Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars [2019Q003],Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars,This work was supported by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (2019Q003).,,37,1,1,4,24,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1664-8021,,FRONT GENET,Front.

Predicting elastic parameters by a conventional CNN. which is used for image classification such as LeNet and AlexNet, lacks geophysical constraints, and its accuracy in predicting elastic parameters is poor, with limited training data available. The combination of a U-Net and a convolutional neural network (CUCNN) is proposed to predict the elastic parameters from digital rock images with limited training data. In CUCNN, the rock matrix and pore types segmented from gray-scale images are treated as constraints that induce the convolutional kernels to extract the global as well as the local-scale rock features. The loss function, designed in a composite form to accelerate the convergence speed, contains the segmentation error and elastic parameters predicted from the gray-scale images. By adding geophysical constraints to the CNN. an implicit representation from the gray-scale image to the elastic parameters can be gained, which can improve the accuracy and efficiency of parameter prediction. Our method was tested using training and verification data derived from 1800 2D image slices of Berea sandstone samples, and the results were compared against the CNN model. The V-P and V-S were calculated by the finite-element method as the control to test the performance of both models.

The RRAM based crossbar array (RRAM CBA) is usually employed to accelerate DNN because of its intrinsic characteristic of executing multiplication-and-accumulation (MAC) operation according to Kirchhoffs' law. However, some major non-ideal effects including IR-drop and Stuck-at-Faults (SAF) in real RRAM CBA are typically ignored in the DNN accelerator design because of the considerations of training speed and design closure. Such non-ideal effects will conduct the variations of output column current and voltage and further cause serious degradation in computing accuracy. Thus, direct mapping from the weights of DNN model without considering the IR-drop and SAF to RRAM CBA is unrealistic. In this work, two efficient and optimized methods including adding additional tunable RRAM row and Trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) based RRAM are proposed to recover the computation accuracy with a view to reducing variation of the output column current of the RRAM CBA and output voltage of the TIA in each column respectively. The two optimized methods are evaluated in different sizes of RRAM CBA and different resistance levels of RRAM cell. The simulation results show that the two optimized methods can further suppress the degradation of computing accuracy induced by IR-drop and SAF for LeNet-5 with the MNIST dataset and VGG16 with the CIFAR-10 dataset.","[Huang, Chenglong; Ma, Desheng; Fang, Liang] Natl Univ Def Technol, Inst Quantum Informat, Changsha 410073, Peoples R China; [Huang, Chenglong; Ma, Desheng; Fang, Liang] Natl Univ Def Technol, State Key Lab High Performance Comp, Changsha 410073, Peoples R China; [Xu, Nuo] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Comp, Changsha 410073, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Keni; Zhu, Yujie] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China",,"Xu, N (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Comp, Changsha 410073, Peoples R China.",oun_ux@163.com,,"Huang, Chenglong/0000-0001-6241-9745; Xu, Nuo/0000-0003-1224-7345",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFB1003304]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61832007]; Research Foundation from NUDT [ZK20-02],National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Foundation from NUDT,This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018YFB1003304; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61832007; and in part by the Research Foundation from NUDT under Grant ZK20-02.,,27,6,6,0,6,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-6734,,,IEEE J ELECTRON DEVI,IEEE J.

Thanks to the development of biological experimental techniques, many ribosome footprintings are generated, which can help us to study ribosome stalling. Effectively obtaining a precise ribosome stalling site will be helpful for the treatment of the related diseases, however there is still much room for the improvement of ribosome stalling prediction. In this study, we propose a new deep neural network model named DeepRibSt for the prediction of ribosome stalling sites. We first process the ribosome footprinting data to the training set. Then three new features, including evolutionary conservation, hydrophobicity, and amino dissociation constant, along with the previous sequence features, are extracted as input to the network. To improve the performance of the algorithm in ribosome stalling prediction, we use two convolutional layers and three fully connected layers to design a new network architecture. To verify the validity of our proposed DeepRibSt, we compare DeepRibSt with four popular deep neural networks, i.e., AlexNet, LeNet, ResNet, and LSTM on human (i.e., Battle2015 and Stumpf13) and yeast (i.e., Pop2014, Young15, and Brar12) data. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepRibS, we compare DeepRibSt with the state-of-the-art method. The experimental results show that DeepRibSt outperforms all other methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, recall, specificity, F1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).","[Zhang, Yuan] Xiangtan Univ, Sch Math & Computat Sci, Xiangtan 411105, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuan; He, Xizhi; Lu, Jing; Gao, Xieping] Xiangtan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Comp & Informat Proc, Xiangtan 411105, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Sai] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Dept Genet, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Gao, Xieping] Xiangnan Univ, Coll Med Imaging & Inspect, Chenzhou 423000, Peoples R China",,"Gao, XP (corresponding author), Xiangtan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Comp & Informat Proc, Xiangtan 411105, Peoples R China.;Gao, XP (corresponding author), Xiangnan Univ, Coll Med Imaging & Inspect, Chenzhou 423000, Peoples R China.",xpgao@xtu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972333, 61802328, 61771415]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province in China [2019JJ50606]; Research Foundation of Education Department of Hunan Province of China [19B561]; Baidu Pinecone Program",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province in China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Research Foundation of Education Department of Hunan Province of China; Baidu Pinecone Program,"The authors are grateful to Prof. Jianyang Zeng and Dr. Hailin Hu for their help with the ideas and code of this work.

Despite their apparent success, these studies only report accuracy, precision, and recall of the positive class (member class). Hence, the performance of these attacks have not been clearly reported on negative class (non-member class). In this paper, we show that the way the MI attack performance has been reported is often misleading because they suffer from high false positive rate or false alarm rate (FAR) that has not been reported. FAR shows how often the attack model mislabel non-training samples (non-member) as training (member) ones. The high FAR makes MI attacks fundamentally impractical, which is particularly more significant for tasks such as membership inference where the majority of samples in reality belong to the negative (non-training) class. Moreover, we show that the current MI attack models can only identify the membership of misclassified samples with mediocre accuracy at best, which only constitute a very small portion of training samples. We analyze several new features that have not been comprehensively explored for membership inference before, including distance to the decision boundary and gradient norms, and conclude that deep models' responses are mostly similar among train and non-train samples. We conduct several experiments on image classification tasks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, using various model architecture, including LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet, etc. We show that the current state-of-the-art MI attacks cannot achieve high accuracy and low FAR at the same time, even when the attacker is given several advantages.","[Rezaei, Shahbaz; Liu, Xin] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Rezaei, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",srezaei@ucdavis.edu; xinliu@ucdavis.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS-1547461, CNS-1718901, IIS-1838207]",National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant CNS-1547461, Grant CNS-1718901, and Grant IIS-1838207",,26,0,0,1,2,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",1063-6919,,978-1-6654-4509-2,PROC CVPR IEEE,,,2021.0,,,,,,,7888,7896,,10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00780,0.0,,,9,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,BS5QS,,Green Submitted,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000739917308012,0

Methods The standardised Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data sets are used for the proposed model, with additional skull stripping, using the Brain Extraction Tool V.2approach. The 2D CNN architecture is based on LeNet-5, the Leaky Rectified Linear Unit activation function and a Sigmoid function were used, and batch normalisation was added after every convolutional layer to stabilise the learning process. The model was optimised by manually tuning all its hyperparameters. Results The model was evaluated in terms of accuracy, recall, precision and f1-score. The results demonstrate that the model predicted MCI with an accuracy of 0.735, passing the random guessing baseline of 0.521 and predicted AD with an accuracy of 0.837, passing the random guessing baseline of 0.536. Discussion The proposed approach can assist clinicians in the early diagnosis of AD and MCI, with high-enough accuracy, based on relatively smaller data sets, and without the need of HPC infrastructures. Such an approach can alleviate disparities and operationalise fairness in the adoption of medical algorithms. Conclusion Medical AI algorithms should not be focused solely on accuracy but should also be evaluated with respect to how they might impact disparities and operationalise fairness in their adoption.","[Heising, Luca] Maastricht Univ Med Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol Maastro, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Heising, Luca] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Angelopoulos, Spyros] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England",,"Angelopoulos, S (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England.",Spyros.Angelopoulos@durham.ac.uk,"Angelopoulos, Spyros/E-3145-2018","Angelopoulos, Spyros/0000-0002-8165-8204",,,,,27,1,1,0,0,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",,2632-1009,,BMJ HEALTH CARE INFO,BMJ Health Care Inform.,APR,2022.0,29,1,,,,,,,e100485,10.1136/bmjhci-2021-100485,0.0,,,7,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,0V8KL,35477689.0,"gold, Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000788588800001,0

However, the determination of the correct focusing distance is a non-trivial and time consuming issue. A deep learning (DL) solution is proposed to cast the autofocusing as a regression problem and tested over both experimental and simulated holograms. Single wavelength digital holograms were recorded by a Digital Holographic Microscope (DHM) with a 10x microscope objective from a patterned target moving in 3D over an axial range of 92 mu m. Tiny DL models are proposed and compared such as a tiny Vision Transformer (TViT), tiny VGG16 (TVGG) and a tiny Swin-Transfomer (TSwinT). The proposed tiny networks are compared with their original versions (ViT/B16, VGG16 and Swin-Transformer Tiny) and the main neural networks used in digital holography such as LeNet and AlexNet. The experiments show that the predicted focusing distance Z(R)(Pred) is accurately inferred with an accuracy of 1.2 mu m in average in comparison with the DHM depth of field of 15 mu m. Numerical simulations show that all tiny models give the Z(R)(Pred) with an error below 0.3 mu m.

In particular, the topography of the cortical electrical activity is represented by colors, which make it possible to identify functional differences between cortical areas and to associate them with various diseases. The use of cortical topography with EEG origin in the investigation of diseases is often not used due to the representation of colors making it difficult to classify the disease. Thus, the analyses have been carried out, mainly, based on the EEG tracings. Therefore, a computer system that recognizes disease patterns through cortical topography can be a solution to the diagnostic aid. In view of this, this study compared five models of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), namely: Inception v3, SqueezeNet, LeNet, VGG-16 and VGG-19, in order to know the patterns in cortical topography images obtained with EEG, in Parkinson's disease, Depression and Bipolar Disorder. SqueezeNet performed better in the 3 diseases analyzed, with Parkinson's disease being better evaluated for Accuracy (88.89%), Precison (86.36%), Recall (91.94%) and F1 Score (89.06%), the other CNNs had less performance. In the analysis of the values of the Area under ROC Curve (AUC), SqueezeNet reached (93.90%) for Parkinson's disease, (75.70%) for Depression and (72.10%) for Bipolar Disorder. We understand that there is the possibility of classifying neurological diseases from cortical topographies with the use of CNNs and, thus, creating a computational basis for the implementation of software for screening and possible diagnostic assistance.","[de Meneses, Francisco Gerson A.; Teles, Ariel Soares; Nunes, Monara; da Silva Farias, Daniel; Teixeira, Silmar] Fed Univ Parnaiba Delta, Neuroinnovat Technol & Brain Mapping Lab, Ave Sao Sebastiao,2819 Bairro Sao Benedito, BR-64202020 Parnaiba, Piaui, Brazil; [Teles, Ariel Soares; da Silva Farias, Daniel; Teixeira, Silmar] Fed Univ Parnaiba Delta, Postgrad Program Biotechnol, Parnaiba, Brazil; [de Meneses, Francisco Gerson A.; Nunes, Monara; Teixeira, Silmar] Univ Fed Piaui, Northeast Biotechnol Network, Teresina, Brazil; [Teles, Ariel Soares] Fed Inst Maranhao, Araioses, Brazil",,"de Meneses, FGA (corresponding author), Fed Univ Parnaiba Delta, Neuroinnovat Technol & Brain Mapping Lab, Ave Sao Sebastiao,2819 Bairro Sao Benedito, BR-64202020 Parnaiba, Piaui, Brazil.;de Meneses, FGA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Piaui, Northeast Biotechnol Network, Teresina, Brazil.",gerson@ifpi.edu.br,,"A. de Meneses, Francisco Gerson/0000-0002-5242-9656",Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); State of MaranhAo Research Funding Agency (FAPEMA),Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); State of MaranhAo Research Funding Agency (FAPEMA),The authors would like to thank the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and State of MaranhAo Research Funding Agency (FAPEMA).,,96,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0896-0267,1573-6792,,BRAIN TOPOGR,Brain Topogr.,JUL,2022.0,35,4,,,,,464,480,,10.1007/s10548-022-00901-4,0.0,,MAY 2022,17,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology,3I5UO,35596851.0,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000799674700001,0

Deep learning is an increasingly common approach for image classification, a fundamental task in many applications. Due to its high computational requirements, implementation in edge devices becomes challenging. Cloud computing serves as an enabler, allowing devices with limited resources to perform deep learning. For cloud computing, however, latency is an issue and is undesirable. Edge computing addresses the issue by redistributing data and tasks closer to the edge. Still, a suitable offloading strategy is required to ensure optimal performance with methods such as LeNet-5, OAHR, and Autoencoder (ANC) as feature extractors paired with different classifiers (such as artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM)). In this study, models are evaluated using a dataset representing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task. The OCR application has recently been used in many task-offloading studies. The evaluation is based on the time performance and scoring criteria. In terms of time performance, a fully connected ANN using features from the ANC is faster by a factor of over 60 times compared to the fastest performing SVM. Moreover, scoring performance shows that the SVM is less prone to overfit in the case of a noisy or imbalanced dataset in comparison with ANN. So, adopting SVM in which the data distribution is unspecified will be wiser as there is a lower tendency to overfit. The training and inference time, however, are generally higher than ANN.","[Tan, Kenneth Kean Hoong; Nugroho, Hermawan] Univ Nottingham Malaysia, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Semenyih 43500, Selangor, Malaysia; [Wong, Yee Wan] Univ Putra Malaysia, UPM MTDC Technol Ctr 3, Merimen Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",,"Nugroho, H (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham Malaysia, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Semenyih 43500, Selangor, Malaysia.",Kenneth.Tan@nottingham.edu.my; yeewan6823@gmail.com; Hermawan.Nugroho@nottingham.edu.my,,,Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) [FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/UNIM/02/4]; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE),"Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS); Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE)(Ministry of Education, Malaysia)",This work is supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) FRGS/1/2018/ICT02/UNIM/02/4 from the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE) .,,37,0,0,0,0,UNIV PUTRA MALAYSIA PRESS,SELANGOR,"SERDANG, SELANGOR, 00000, MALAYSIA",0128-7680,,,PERTANIKA J SCI TECH,Pertanika J.

This paper proposes two novel low power high speed architectures for approximate 4:2 compressor that can be employed in multipliers for partial product summation. The two designs presented (Design-1 and Design-2) have Error Distance (ED) of +/- 1 and Error Rate (ER) of 25%. The proposed Design-1 and Design-2 are able to achieve reduction in power and delay by (62.50%, 47.67%) and (83.13%, 60.20%), respectively, in comparison with the exact 4:2 compressor. To verify the effectiveness of the design, the proposed architectures are used to implement 8x8 Dadda multiplier. The equal number of errors in positive and negative directions in the proposed designs aid in reducing the Mean Error Distance (MED) and Mean Relative Error Distance (MRED) of the multiplier. Multiplication of images and two-level decomposition of 2D Haar wavelets are implemented using the designed Dadda multiplier. The efficiency of the image processing applications is measured in terms of Mean Structural Similarity (MSSIM) index and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and an average of 0.98 and 35dB, respectively, is obtained, which are in the acceptable range. In addition, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based LeNet-1 Handwritten Digit Recognition System (HDRS) is implemented using the proposed compressor-based multipliers.

Since DNN usually contains several billions of parameters, the asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) algorithm is often used to train an effective DNN model on a computer cluster. However, as the increase of computing nodes and data size, ASGD suffers from serious slow convergence deficiency because the parameters might be wrongly updated by long-term delayed gradients. In this paper, we propose a delay compensated asynchronous Adam (DC-Adam) algorithm to train DNN. In particular, DC-Adam updates the parameters with the moment increment which is the division of the first and the second moments to take the advantage of the original Adam algorithm, and compensates the gradient with the first-order component in its Taylor expansion. Since the delay compensation technique reduces the error of delayed gradients, and the moment increment further counteracts the influence of approximated compensation, DC-Adam converges much more rapidly than ASGD on a computer cluster with moderate computing nodes. We theoretically analyze the Ergodic convergence rate of DC-Adam and compare with DC-ASGD. We implement our DC-Adam algorithm on 61 computing nodes in a computer cluster, and conduct image classification by using LeNet and ResNet, respectively, on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that DC-Adam greatly accelerates the training progress and achieves almost linear speedup rate as increasing the computing nodes.","[Guan, Naiyang; Yang, Canqun] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Comp, Inst Software, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Shan, Lei; Xu, Weixia; Zhang, Minxuan] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Comp, Inst Comp, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China",,"Shan, L (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Comp, Inst Comp, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China.",,,,National Key research and Development Program of China [2016YFB0200401],National Key research and Development Program of China,This work was partially supported by National Key research and Development Program of China (under grant No. 2016YFB0200401).,,20,4,4,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2158-9178,,978-1-5386-3790-6,IEEE INT SYMP PARAL,,,2017.0,,,,,,,852,859,,10.1109/ISPA/IUCC.2017.00130,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Telecommunications,BM4YH,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000464435000120,0

Basically, we can easily and largely reduce the number of weights of a trained deep model by adopting a widely used model compression technique, e.g., pruning. In this way, two kinds of data are usually preserved for this compressed model, i.e., non-zero weights and meta-data. where metadata is employed to help encode and decode these non-zero weights. Although we can obtain an ideally small number of non-zero weights through pruning, existing sparse matrix coding methods still need a much larger amount of meta-data (may several times larger than non-zero weights), which will be a severe bottleneck of the deploying of very deep models. To tackle this issue, we propose a layerwise sparse coding (LSC) method to maximize the compression ratio by extremely reducing the amount of meta-data. We first divide a sparse matrix into multiple small blocks and remove zero blocks, and then propose a novel signed relative index (SRI) algorithm to encode the remaining non-zero blocks (with much less meta-data). In addition, the proposed LSC performs parallel matrix multiplication without full decoding, while traditional methods cannot. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LSC achieves substantial gains in pruned DNN compression (e.g., 51.03x compression ratio on ADMM-Lenet) and inference computation (i.e., time reduction and extremely less memory bandwidth), over stateof-the-art baselines.","[Liu, Xiao; Li, Wenbin; Huo, Jing; Yao, Lili; Gao, Yang] Nanjing Univ, Natl Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China",,"Gao, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Natl Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",liuxiao730@outlook.com; liwenbin.nju@gmail.com; huojing@nju.edu.cn; yaolili93@163.com; gaoy@nju.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [2018AAA0100905]; Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation [61432008, 61806092];  [BK20180326]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); ,"This work is supported by Science and Technology Innovation 2030-New Generation Artificial Intelligence Major Project No.(2018AAA0100905), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61432008, 61806092), and Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation (No. BK20180326).",,27,5,5,0,0,ASSOC ADVANCEMENT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,PALO ALTO,"2275 E BAYSHORE RD, STE 160, PALO ALTO, CA 94303 USA",2159-5399,2374-3468,978-1-57735-835-0,AAAI CONF ARTIF INTE,,,2020.0,34,,,,,,4900,4907,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Education & Educational Research,BR7FR,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000667722804119,0

This leads to various effects such as beam spreading, wandering and scintillation (intensity fluctuation) which are responsible for severe signal degrading of the free space optical (FSO) communication system.

Non-conventional adaptive optics is demonstrated using complex search algorithms which requires large number of iterations and computations to obtain the optimum value of the results. In this paper, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based novel wavefront aberration compensation technique is proposed. The aim of this work is to experience and validate the CNN-based wavefront sensorless adaptive optics (WFSLess AO) technique for 70 m realtime FSOC. The major issues such as time-consuming iterative processes and latency in complex search algorithms and similar algorithms are greatly avoided by detecting the wavefront distortion from the direct images of the optical beam used in the experimentation. LeNet CNN architecture is realized to compensate wavefront distortion for the acquired data sample under different weather condition.

The mortality rate due to cervical cancer is approximately 90% in low or middle income countries due to lack of suitable pre-screening procedures and experienced medical staff. Colposcopy images or cervigrams, are the images that capture the cervical region, are considered as the gold standard by the medical experts for the identification and evaluation of cervical cancer. The visual assessment of cervigrams for recognizing cancer suffers from high inter- or intra-variations especially among less or unskilled medical experts. However, this method is dependent on colposcopists' observation and it is more time consuming, tedious and laborious task which calls for development of computer-aided method for diagnosis of cervical cancer. With the technological advancements, deep learning has been commonly employed for providing automated solutions for disease diagnosis due to its self-learning capability. This paper presents a deep-learning-based method for cervix cancer classification using colposcopy images. The architecture of the proposed method namely, ColpoNet, has been motivated by the DenseNet model because it is computationally more efficient as compared to other models. Further, the method has been tested and validated on the dataset released by the National Cancer Institute and it has been compared with other deep-learning models namely AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50, LeNet and GoogleNet to check scope of its applicability. The experimental analysis revealed that ColpoNet achieved an accuracy of 81.353% and shows the highest performance rate as compared to other state-of-the-art deep techniques.

In recent years, deep learning models have been widely used in data-driven FDD methods because of their automatic feature learning capability. In general, these models are trained on historical sensor data, and therefore, it is very difficult to meet the real-time requirement of online FDD applications. Since transfer learning can solve different but similar problems in the target domain efficiently and effectively with the knowledge learned from the source domain, this paper proposes an online fault diagnosis method based on a deep transfer convolutional neural network (TCNN) framework. The TCNN framework is made up of an online CNN based on LeNet-5 and several offline CNNs with a shallow structure. First, time-domain signal data are converted into images that contain abundant fault information and are suitable as the input of CNN. Then, the online CNN is constructed to automatically extract representative features from the converted images and classify faults. Finally, in order to improve the real-time performance of the online CNN, several offline CNNs are also constructed and pretrained on related data sets. By directly transferring the shallow layers of the trained offline CNNs to the online CNN, the online CNN can significantly improve the real-time performance and successfully address the issue of achieving the desired diagnostic accuracy within limited training time. The proposed method is validated on two bearing data sets and one pump data set, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method using three data sets are 99.88, 99.13, and 99.98, respectively. The experimental results also indicate that the improvement of accuracy is 19.21 for the motor bearing case, 29.82 for the rolling mill bearing case, and 33.26 for the pump case during the early stage of learning.","[Xu, Gaowei; Liu, Min; Jiang, Zhuofu; Huang, Chenxi] Tongji Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China; [Shen, Weiming] Tongji Univ, Key Lab Embedded Syst & Serv Comp, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China; [Shen, Weiming] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Digital Mfg Equipment & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",,"Liu, M (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China.",lmin@tongji.edu.cn,"Huang, Chenxi/AAC-6316-2019","Shen, Weiming/0000-0001-5204-7992","Natural Science Foundation of China [71690234, 61573257]; China Scholarship Council",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71690234 and Grant 61573257 and in part by the China Scholarship Council.,,45,139,145,51,363,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9456,1557-9662,,IEEE T INSTRUM MEAS,IEEE Trans.

However, they face the problem that the detection accuracy will be greatly reduced after pruning. Given the above, this paper proposes filter pruning via a technique called hybrid-order difference, which is based on Poisson distribution. According to this technique, some filters in each convolutional layer are removed, thus the number of parameters of the employed classifiers is highly reduced. The first-order and second-order difference for the L1-norm of filter parameters are calculated, they are given weights and they are converted into activity indices through the Min-Max function. The proposed method can fully explore the relationship between the weights and avoid the problem of threshold selection in pruning. Experiments were carried out on the LeNet-5, VGG16, ResNet18 and ResNet50 convolutional neural networks based on the 2019 Distributed Denial of Service dataset (the DDoS dataset) of the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity, the 2014 experimental dataset of the Mississippi State University related to a natural gas pipeline (the gas dataset), and the dataset for an oil depot (the oil dataset). The results showed that the proposed method can effectively prune the employed intrusion detection classifiers, such as removing 83.74% of the Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) for VGG16 with only a 0.10% reduction of accuracy. As such, it greatly alleviates the load pressure generated by the above-mentioned classifiers in the context of edge industrial control systems.","[Liu, Xue-Jun; Wang, Hao; Yan, Yong; Sha, Yun] Beijing Inst Petrochem Technol, Coll Informat Engn, 19 Qingyuan North Rd, Beijing 102617, Peoples R China; [Luan, Hai-Ying] Beijing Res Inst Automat Machinery Ind Co Ltd, Fluid Drive & Car Equipment Tech Engn Dept, Beijing 100120, Peoples R China",,"Liu, XJ (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Petrochem Technol, Coll Informat Engn, 19 Qingyuan North Rd, Beijing 102617, Peoples R China.",lxj@bipt.edu.cn; caseywang97@foxmail.com; lhying1129@aliyun.com; yanyong@bipt.edu.cn; shayun@bipt.edu.cn,,,National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [BIPTACF-008];  [2018AAA0102900],National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China; ,"This research was funded by means of two projects, that is BIPTACF-008 and the National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (No.2018AAA0102900).",,24,0,0,4,4,NATL INST R&D INFORMATICS-ICI,BUCHAREST,"PUBL DEPT, 8-10 AVERESCU BLVD, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 011455, ROMANIA",1220-1766,,,STUD INFORM CONTROL,Stud.

The DNN fuzzing leverages various inputs prioritization methods to guide the testing process. The current research mainly focus on constructing testing metrics that symbolize the logical representation of the DNN to guide the generation of test cases, which neglects the potential performance brought by implementing heuristic algorithm. Moreover, the straightforward implementation of queue structure can not represent the metamorphic relationships between generated inputs in DNN fuzzing. Therefore, developing the appropriate heuristic algorithm-based inputs prioritization method is critical to improve the performance of DNN fuzzers. In this paper, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based inputs prioritization method called E x 2 $E{x}<^>{2}$ (Exploration and Exploitation) that formulates DNN testing exploration as the sequential decision process. The technique introduces an innovative tree-structure design that schedules inputs from the statistical perspective. Different from traditional DNN testing, the batch pool is maintained in the form of nodes in MCTS. The links between nodes precisely represent the metamorphic relationship between input batches, which indicates the potential value for in-depth search. Furthermore, a novel simulation mechanism is implemented to adapt MCTS in DNN testing, which attain better coverage feedback. The effectiveness of our method is comprehensively investigated on six popular deep learning models from LeNet and VGG families. The comparison experiments are conducted between DeepHunter, TensorFuzz, and DeepSmartFuzzer to demonstrate efficacy on various testing metrics. The experimental results show that the E x 2 $E{x}<^>{2}$ significantly enhance the coverage gain of DNN fuzzing up to 30% against the best performance in comparison groups.","[Ye, Aoshuang; Wang, Lina; Zhao, Lei; Ke, Jianpeng] Wuhan Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Key Lab Aerosp Informat Secur & Trusted Comp, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",,"Wang, LN; Zhao, L (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Key Lab Aerosp Informat Secur & Trusted Comp, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",lnwang@whu.edu.cn; leizhao@whu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61876134]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFB1805400],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 61876134; National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: No.2020YFB1805400",,40,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0884-8173,1098-111X,,INT J INTELL SYST,Int.

The high computational energy and time requirements hinder the practical application of CNNs; hence, the realization of a highly energy-efficient and fast-learning neural network has aroused interest. In this work, we address the computing-resource-saving problem by developing a deep model, termed the Gabor convolutional neural network (Gabor CNN), which incorporates highly expression-efficient Gabor kernels into CNNs. In order to effectively imitate the structural characteristics of traditional weight kernels, we improve upon the traditional Gabor filters, having stronger frequency and orientation representations. In addition, we propose a procedure to train Gabor CNNs, termed the fast training method (FTM). In FTM, we design a new training method based on the multipopulation genetic algorithm (MPGA) and evaluation structure to optimize improved Gabor kernels, but train the rest of the Gabor CNN parameters with back-propagation. The training of improved Gabor kernels with MPGA is much more energy-efficient with less samples and iterations. Simple tasks, like character recognition on the Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST), traffic sign recognition on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), and face detection on the Olivetti Research Laboratory database (ORL), are implemented using LeNet architecture. The experimental result of the Gabor CNN and MPGA training method shows a 17-19% reduction in computational energy and time and an 18-21% reduction in storage requirements with a less than 1% accuracy decrease.

To ensure the structural health and reliability of the buildings, frequent structure inspection and monitoring for surface cracks is important. Surface inspection conducted by humans is time-consuming and may produce inconsistent results due to the inspectors' varied empirical knowledge. In the field of structural health monitoring, visual inspection of surface cracks on civil structures using deep learning algorithms has gained considerable attention. However, these vision-based techniques require high-quality images as inputs and depend on high computational power for image classification. Thus, in this study, shallow convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architecture for surface concrete crack detection is proposed. LeNet-5, a well-known CNN architecture, is optimized and trained for image classification using 40,000 images in the Middle East Technical University (METU) dataset. To achieve maximum accuracy for crack detection with minimum computation, the hyperparameters of the proposed model were optimized. The proposed model enables the employment of deep learning algorithms using low-power computational devices for a hassle-free monitoring of civil structures. The performance of the proposed model is compared with those of various pretrained deep learning models, such as VGG16, Inception, and ResNet. The proposed shallow CNN architecture was found to achieve a maximum accuracy of 99.8% in the minimum computation. Better hyperparameter optimization in CNN architecture results in higher accuracy even with a shallow layer stack for enhanced computation. The evaluation results confirm the incorporation of the proposed method with autonomous devices, such as unmanned aerial vehicle, for real-time inspection of surface crack with minimum computation.","[Kim, Bubryur; Yuvaraj, N.] Dong A Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Busan 49315, South Korea; [Sri Preethaa, K.

Although traditional diagnosis methods offered a vital role in early-stage treatment, they are generally time- and resource-consuming. In this context, computer-aided approaches for automatic diagnosis emerged in the literature since early detection is intrinsically related to remission probabilities. However, they still suffer from drawbacks because of the lack of available data for machine learning purposes, thus implying reduced recognition rates. This work introduces Generative Adversarial Networks to generate high-quality endoscopic images, thereby identifying Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma more precisely. Further, Convolution Neural Networks are used for feature extraction and classification purposes. The proposed approach is validated over two datasets of endoscopic images, with the experiments conducted over the full and patch-split images. The application of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks for the data augmentation step and LeNet-5 and AlexNet for the classification step allowed us to validate the proposed methodology over an extensive set of datasets (based on original and augmented sets), reaching results of 90% of accuracy for the patch-based approach and 85% for the image-based approach. Both results are based on augmented datasets and are statistically different from the ones obtained in the original datasets of the same kind. Moreover, the impact of data augmentation was evaluated in the context of image description and classification, and the results obtained using synthetic images outperformed the ones over the original datasets, as well as other recent approaches from the literature. Such results suggest promising insights related to the importance of proper data for the accurate classification concerning computerassisted Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma detection.","[de Souza Jr, Luis A.] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Comp, UFSCar, Sao Carlos, Brazil; [Passos, Leandro A.; Papa, Joao P.] Sao Paulo State Univ, Dept Comp, UNESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Souza Jr, Luis A.; Mendel, Robert; Palm, Christoph] Ostbayer TH Regensburg OTH Regensburg, Regensburg Med Image Comp ReMIC, Regensburg, Germany; [Mendel, Robert; Palm, Christoph] Ostbayer TH Regensburg OTH Regensburg, Regensburg Ctr Hlth Sci & Technol RCHST, Regensburg, Germany; [Ebigbo, Alanna; Probst, Andreas; Messmann, Helmut] Univ Hosp Augsburg, Dept Gastroenterol, Augsburg, Germany",,"Papa, JP (corresponding author), Sao Paulo State Univ, Dept Comp, UNESP, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",joao.papa@unesp.br,"Palm, Christoph/F-4943-2014; Messmann, Helmut/AAQ-3568-2021; Ebigbo, Alanna/ACP-0443-2022","Palm, Christoph/0000-0001-9468-2871; Souza Jr., Luis Antonio/0000-0002-7060-6097","DFG [PA 1595/3-1]; Capes/Alexander von Humboldt Foundation [BEX 0581-16-0]; CNPq [306166/2014-3, 307066/2017-7]; FAPESP [2013/07375-0, 2014/12236-1, 2017/04847-9, 2019/08605-5, 2019/065337, 2019/07665-4]",DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Capes/Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"The authors thank DFG grant PA 1595/3-1, Capes/Alexander von Humboldt Foundation grant number BEX 0581-16-0, CNPq grants 306166/2014-3 and 307066/2017-7, as well as FAPESP grants 2013/07375-0, 2014/12236-1, 2017/04847-9, 2019/08605-5, 2019/065337, and 2019/07665-4.",,65,12,12,0,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0010-4825,1879-0534,,COMPUT BIOL MED,Comput.

Firstly, our method is used to classify cracks first and detect the classified crack images, different deep learning models are used in these two parts to achieve different functions. Secondly, in the crack classification section, in view of the low proportion of effective concrete pavement crack images in the mass images collected by crack detection vehicle, the output dimension of FC2 layer of LeNet-5 model is modified before crack detection. It can accurately identify the concrete pavement cracks from several types of disturbance characteristics by training the classification model.

The information processing mechanism of SNN combines the concepts of time and space. To address the performance dropping problem during the conversion process from the artificial neural network (ANN) to SNN, this paper proposes a proportional attenuation leaky integrate-and-fire (RA-LIF) neuron model to solve the problem of membrane potential loss caused by leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. The accuracy of the SNN network based on RA-LIF neurons on MNIST is 98.76%. This paper also proposes a weight normalization method to help adjust the network spiking rate to reduce the loss. We evaluate and analyze the performance of SNN networks based on LIF, RA-LIF, and AD-LIF. By analyzing the spike firing rate and convergence rate, the effects of spike frequency and neuron threshold on the performance of the network are discussed. So far, the SNN transformed by ANN can only achieve worse or similar performance compared with the original network. For the first time, the performance of the SNN transformed by the proposed RA-LIF neuron model and weight normalization method is better than the original network, which shows the test accuracy of 98.88% on MNIST. The SNN obtained by converting the LeNet network using the above method achieves a test accuracy of 98.91% on MNIST. In conclusion, the RA-LIF neuron model and normalization method proposed in this paper have promising applicability. Moreover, this method has the characteristics of high precision and fast calculation speed, which can provide a reference for the research of the SNN framework.","[Niu, Li-Ye; Wei, Ying; Long, Jun-Yu; Liu, Wen-Bo] Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China; [Wei, Ying] Northeastern Univ, Key Lab Med Imaging Calculat, Minist Educ, Shenyang 110179, Peoples R China; [Wei, Ying] Peking Univ, Informat Technol R&D Innovat Ctr, Shaoxing, Peoples R China",,"Wei, Y (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China.;Wei, Y (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Key Lab Med Imaging Calculat, Minist Educ, Shenyang 110179, Peoples R China.;Wei, Y (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Informat Technol R&D Innovat Ctr, Shaoxing, Peoples R China.",weiying@ise.neu.edu.cn,,,"National Nature Science Foundation of China [61871106, 61370152]; Key R & D projects of Liaoning Province, China [2020JH2/10100029]; Open Project Program Foundation of the Key Laboratory of Opto-Electronics Information Processing, Chinese Academy of Sciences [OEIP-O-202002]","National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key R & D projects of Liaoning Province, China; Open Project Program Foundation of the Key Laboratory of Opto-Electronics Information Processing, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This work is supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61871106 and No. 61370152), Key R & D projects of Liaoning Province, China (Grant No. 2020JH2/10100029), and the Open Project Program Foundation of the Key Laboratory of Opto-Electronics Information Processing, Chinese Academy of Sciences (OEIP-O-202002).",,32,1,1,5,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1370-4621,1573-773X,,NEURAL PROCESS LETT,Neural Process.

Contrapose the highly integrated, multiple types of faults and complex working conditions of aircraft electro hydrostatic actuator (EHA), to effectively identify its typical faults, we propose a fault diagnosis method based on fusion convolutional neural networks (FCNN). First, the aircraft EHA fault data is encoded by gram angle difference field (GADF) to obtain the fault feature images. Then we build a FCNN model that integrates the 1DCNN and 2DCNN, where the original 1D fault data is the input of the 1DCNN model, and the feature images obtained by GADF transformation are used as the input of 2DCNN. Multiple convolution and pooling operations are performed on each of these inputs to extract the features. Next these feature vectors are spliced in the convergence layer, and the fully connected layers and the Softmax layers are finally used to attain the classification of aircraft EHA faults. Furthermore, the multi-strategy hybrid particle swarm optimization (MSPSO) algorithm is applied to optimize the FCNN to obtain a better combination of FCNN hyperparameters; MSPSO incorporates various strategies, including an initialization strategy based on homogenization and randomization, and an adaptive inertia weighting strategy, etc. The experimental result indicates that the FCNN model optimized by MSPSO achieves an accuracy of 96.86% for identifying typical faults of the aircraft EHA, respectively, higher than the 1DCNN and the 2DCNN by about 16.5% and 5.7%. By comparing with LeNet-5, GoogleNet, AlexNet, and GRU, the FCNN model presents the highest diagnostic accuracy, less time in training and testing. The comprehensive performance of the proposed model is demonstrated to be much stronger. Additionally, the FCNN model improved by MSPSO has a higher accuracy rate when compared to PSO.","[Li, Xudong; Li, Yanjun; Cao, Yuyuan; Duan, Shixuan; Wang, Xingye; Zhao, Zejian] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Civil Aviat, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China",,"Li, YJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Civil Aviat, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China.",lyj@nuaa.edu.cn,,", li xu dong/0000-0003-2368-1593; Duan, Shixuan/0000-0002-9270-7411",Aero-Science Fund of China [20200033052001]; Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics Postgraduate Innovation Base Open Fund [kfjj20200725],Aero-Science Fund of China; Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics Postgraduate Innovation Base Open Fund,"This research was funded by the Aero-Science Fund of China, grant number (20200033052001) and Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics Postgraduate Innovation Base Open Fund, grant number (kfjj20200725).",,39,1,1,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

The work done deals with developing an AI-based framework that can help radiologists and other healthcare professionals diagnose COVID-19 cases at a high level of accuracy. However, in the absence of publicly available CT datasets, the development of such AI tools can prove challenging. Therefore, an algorithm for performing automatic and accurate COVID-19 classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), pre-trained model, and Sparrow search algorithm (SSA) on CT lung images was proposed. The pre-trained CNN models used are SeresNext50, SeresNext101, SeNet154, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3Small, and MobileNetV3Large. In addition, the SSA will be used to optimize the different CNN and transfer learning(TL) hyperparameters to find the best configuration for the pre-trained model used and enhance its performance. Two datasets are used in the experiments. There are two classes in the first dataset, while three in the second. The authors combined two publicly available COVID-19 datasets as the first dataset, namely the COVID-19 Lung CT Scans and COVID-19 CT Scan Dataset. In total, 14,486 images were included in this study. The authors analyzed the Large COVID-19 CT scan slice dataset in the second dataset, which utilized 17,104 images. Compared to other pre-trained models on both classes datasets, MobileNetV3Large pre-trained is the best model. As far as the three-classes dataset is concerned, a model trained on SeNet154 is the best available.

Currently, many choices for neural network frameworks exist for executing AI models in applications, especially for training/inference purposes, including TensorFlow, Caffe, MXNet, PyTorch, Core ML, TensorFlow Lite, and NNAPI. With so many different emerging frameworks, exchange formats are needed for different AI frameworks. Given this requirement, the Khronos group created a standard draft known as the Neural Network Exchange Format (NNEF). However, because NNEF is new, conversion tools for various AI frameworks that would allow the exchange of various AI frameworks remain missing. In this work, we fill this gap by devising NNAPI conversion tools for NNEF. Our work allows NNEF to execute inference tasks on host and Android platforms and flexibly invokes Android neural networks through the API (NNAPI) on the Android platform to speed up inference operations. We invoke NNAPI by dividing the input NNEF model into multiple submodels and let NNAPI execute these submodels. We develop an algorithm named BFSelector that is based on a classic breadth-first search and includes cost constraints to determine how to divide the input model. Our preliminary experimental results show that our support of NNEF on NNAPI can obtain a speedup of 1.32 to 22.52 times over the baseline for API 27 and of 4.56 to 211 times over the baseline for API 28, where the baseline is the NNEF-to-Android platform conversion without invoking NNAPI.

The advanced cognition and pattern recognition abilities possessed by humans are ascribed to the intricate and complex neurological connection in human brains. CNNs are inspired by the neurological structure of the human brain and show performance at par with humans in image recognition and classification tasks. On the lower extreme of the neurological complexity spectrum lie small organisms such as insects and worms, with simple brain structures and limited cognition abilities, pattern recognition, and intelligent decision-making abilities. However, billions of years of evolution guided by natural selection have imparted basic survival instincts, which appear as an intelligent behavior. In this paper, we put forward the evidence that a simple algorithm inspired by the behavior of a beetle (an insect) can fool CNNs in image classification tasks by just perturbing a single pixel. The proposed algorithm accomplishes this in a computationally efficient manner as compared to the other adversarial attacking algorithms proposed in the literature. The novel feature of the proposed algorithm as compared to other metaheuristics approaches for fooling a neural network, is that it mimics the behavior of a single beetle and requires fewer search particles. On the contrary, other metaheuristic algorithms rely on the social or swarming behavior of the organisms, requiring a large population of search particles. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm on LeNet-5 and ResNet architecture using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The results show a high success rate for the proposed algorithms. The proposed strategy raises a concern about the robustness and security aspects of artificially intelligent learning systems.","[Khan, Ameer Hamza] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Smart City Res Inst, Kowloon, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Cao, Xinwei] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bin] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Automat, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Li, Shuai] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Informat, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",,"Cao, XW (corresponding author), Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",ahakhan@polyu.edu.hk; xcao.fudan@gmail.com; mileface.binxu@gmail.com; lishuai@lzu.edu.cn,,"KHAN, Ameer Hamza/0000-0002-5367-5277",,,,,66,1,1,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2313-7673,,BIOMIMETICS-BASEL,Biomimetics,SEP,2022.0,7,3,,,,,,,84,10.3390/biomimetics7030084,0.0,,,21,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Biomaterials",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Materials Science,4S4DI,35892354.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000857393000001,0

This work utilizes a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) dataset, and it consists of 1038 abnormal and 641 normal images and naturally transformed technique is used to transfer the data using mathematical operation. We have designed a 22-layers customized CNN with parallel filter architecture to extract highly discriminative features (inter-class and intraclass) from the images to diagnose NFU with two different activation functions, namely Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU). The performance of the NFU-Net is compared with the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) CNN's such as Alex Net, LeNet, DFU-Net, and DFU QUT-Net based on six performance measures (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, Matthews's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) on both original and augmented datasets. The proposed NFU-Net reports an accuracy of nearly 2.5% to 6% higher than conventional CNN's in diagnosing NFU using the DFU dataset. Compared to the traditional CNN's, the proposed network requires lesser network parameters and is computationally efficient. The proposed network could benefit the clinicians for a second opinion about NFU diagnosis. The performance and robustness could be improved while testing the network with other open-source databases.","[Venkatesan, Chandran; Sumithra, M.

Grasping fruit cluster stalks at the top of a stack can improve robotic grasping success and reduce fruit damage. Hence, stalk location is an important factor affecting grasping priority. Because of the disordered arrangement of fruit clusters, stalks are not neatly arranged in horizontal planes, and this makes it difficult to determine grasping priority by stalk vertical location. Therefore, this paper proposes a prioritization method for grasping stacked fruit clusters by extracting and classifying stalk depth sets in RGB-D images. For extracting small stalks with multiple background elements in RGB-D images, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is constructed to reduce the variation in resolution across the feature map and to retain details and local features. To reduce background interference, a coarse-to-fine cascaded Faster R-CNN based on multi-scale feature maps is proposed. A transfer learning scheme is used to improve the network's learning capability for stalk depth sets. Using grape cluster experiments with a robotic sorting system, the proposed method was verified and compared with the existing LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG16, and Faster R-CNN methods. Compared with existing networks, the average precisions of cascaded Faster R-CNN for extracting stalk depth sets and constructed CNN trained by improved transfer learning for grasping prioritization increased by more than 8.01% and 3.79%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately extract and classify stalk depth sets and improve grasping prioritization for stacked fruit clusters.","[Zhang, Qian; Gao, Guoqin] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, 301 Xuefu Rd, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Gao, GQ (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, 301 Xuefu Rd, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",gqgao@ujs.edu.cn,"Gao, Guoqin/GVU-4430-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51375210]; Zhenjiang Municipal Key Research and Development program [GZ2018004]; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [KYCX17_1780],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhenjiang Municipal Key Research and Development program; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 51375210], the Zhenjiang Municipal Key Research and Development program [grant number GZ2018004], and the Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [grant number KYCX17_1780].",,47,7,7,6,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

For example, LeNet-5 is a 7-layer convectional neural network, which can attain more than 99% test accuracy for classification of handwritten digits. CNNs repeats convolution and pooling operations alternately. However, the computational capability of such operations is not clear. We are curious to know a class of problems that can be solved by CNNs. As a formal approach for this task, we introduce a theoretical parallel computational model of CNNs that we call the convolution-pooling machine. It captures the essence of convolution and pooling operations, and application of non-linear activation functions performed in CNNs. In this paper, we assume the convolution-pooling machine operating on 1-dimensional arrays for simplicity, and focus on the problem of classification of inputs by the distance of two feature points. More specifically, we will design a convolution-pooling machine solving the problem D-k (k >= 1), a problem to determine if the distance of the two 1's is at most k or not. For designing the convolution-pooling machine solving the problem Dk, we generate a mixed-integer linear programming problem (MILP) with constraints and objective functions. We have solved the generated linear programming problem for each Dk (1 <= k <= 128) by Gurobi optimizer, a commercial MILP solver. We succeeded in finding a solution for all D-k (1 <= k <= 128) and designing the convolution-pooling machine for solving them. This fact indicates that convolution and pooling operations in CNNs may have the computational capability of classification by the distance of feature points.","[Nakano, Koji; Aoki, Shotaro; Ito, Yasuaki] Hiroshima Univ, Dept Informat Engn, Kagamiyama 1-4-1, Higashihiroshima 7398527, Japan; [Kasagi, Akihiko] Fujitsu Labs Ltd, Nakahara Ku, 4-1-1 Kamikodanaka, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2118588, Japan",,"Nakano, K (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ, Dept Informat Engn, Kagamiyama 1-4-1, Higashihiroshima 7398527, Japan.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,1,2,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",,,978-1-6654-3577-2,,,,2021.0,,,,,,,656,665,,10.1109/IPDPSW52791.2021.00100,0.0,,,10,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BS1GP,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000689576200081,0

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a computer learning system could classify whether a hand radiograph demonstrated osteoporosis based on the second metacarpal cortical percentage. Methods We used the second metacarpal cortical percentage as the osteoporosis predictor. A total of 4,000 posteroanterior (PA) radiographs of the hand were standardized through laterality correction, vertical alignment correction, segmentation, proxy osteoporosis predictor, and full pipeline. Laterality was classified using a LeNet convolutional neural network (CNN). Vertical alignment classification used 2,000 PA x-rays to determine vertical alignment of the second metacarpal. We employed segmentation to determine which pixels belong to the second metacarpal from 1,000 PA x-rays using the FSN-8 CNN. The full pipeline was tested on 265 previously unseen PA x-rays. Results Laterality classification accuracy was 99.62%, with a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 99.3%. Rotation of the hand within 10 degrees of vertical was accurate in 93.2% of films. Segmentation was 94.8% accurate. Proxy osteoporosis predictor was 88.4% accurate. Full pipeline accuracy was 93.9%. In the testing data set, the CNN had a sensitivity of 82.4% and specificity of 95.7%. In the balanced data set, 6 of 39 osteoporotic films were classified as nonosteoporotic; sensitivity was 82.4% and specificity, 94.3%. Conclusions We have created a series of CNN that can accurately identify osteoporosis from non-osteoporosis. Furthermore, our CNN is able to make adjustments to images based on laterality and vertical alignment. Copyright (C) 2020 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.

However, this may increase the numbers of parameters and calculations in the network architecture. When the network model is applied to mobile devices and embedded systems, the storage capacity, computing performance, and memory will become major limitations. A local binary convolutional neural network (LBCNN) has been proposed to reduce the numbers of parameters and calculations. In the LBCNN, the convolutional layer of the CNN is replaced by a local binary convolution (LBC) module. In the LBC module, there is a pre-initialized fixed parametric filter layer. Since the parameters of the filter are generated in a random manner, the result is different each time and therefore unstable. Therefore, to provide a stable and efficient recognition technique for image sensors, we propose a genetic-algorithm-based local binary convolutional neural network (GA-LBCNN) for gender recognition in this study. The genetic algorithm (GA) is used to search for the best filter parameters of the LBCNN. LeNet is adopted as the basic model architecture, and two datasets acquired from image sensors, the CIA and MORPH datasets, are used to perform face gender classification. According to the evaluation results, LBC successfully reduces the numbers of parameters and calculations. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed GA-LBCNN reaches 88.8 and 98.2% for the CIA and MORPH datasets, respectively. Compared with the conventional LBCNN, the classification accuracy of the proposed GA-LBCNN is increased by 7.2 and 1.1%, respectively, for the two datasets.","[Lin, Chun-Hui; Wang, Shyh-Hau] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Lin, Cheng-Jian] Natl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung 411, Taiwan; [Lin, Cheng-Jian] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Intelligence, Taichung 404, Taiwan",,"Lin, CJ (corresponding author), Natl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung 411, Taiwan.;Lin, CJ (corresponding author), Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Intelligence, Taichung 404, Taiwan.",cjlin@ncut.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China, Taiwan; MOST [109-2221-E167-027]","Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); MOST","The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China, Taiwan, for financially supporting this research under Contract No. MOST 109-2221-E167-027.",,21,0,0,0,10,"MYU, SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING DIVISION",TOKYO,"1-23-3-303 SENDAGI, TOKYO, 113-0022, JAPAN",0914-4935,,,SENSOR MATER,Sens.

Therefore, increasing and improving the quality of the crop yield is a major field of interest. Recently, infectious biotic and abiotic diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. Farmers worldwide deal with the issue of plant diseases diagnosis and their proper treatment. With advancements of technology in precision agriculture, there has been quite a few works done for plant diseases classification although, the performances of the existing approaches are not satisfactory. Moreover, most of the previous works fail to accurately segment leaf part from the whole image especially when an image has complex background. Thus, a computer vision approach is proposed in order to address these challenges. The proposed approach consists of two modules. The first module extracts leaf part from whole image by subtracting complex background. The second module introduces a deep learning convolution neural network (CNN), SoyNet, for soybean plant diseases recognition using segmented leaf images. All the experiments are done on Image Database of Plant Disease Symptoms having 16 categories. The proposed model achieves identification accuracy of 98.14% with good precision, recall and f1-score. The proposed method is also compared with three hand-crafted features based state-of-the-art methods and six popularly used deep learning CNN models namely, VGG19, GoogleLeNet, Dense121, XceptionNet, LeNet, and ResNet50.

Based on this, we took some samples from the actual environment for measuring 3D fluorescence data and obtained a batch of public datasets from the internet species. Firstly, we preprocessed the data (including two steps of PARAFAC analysis and CNN dataset generation), and then we proposed a 3D fluorescence classification method and a components fitting method based on VGG16 and VGG11 convolutional neural networks. The VGG16 network is used for the classification of 3D fluorescence data with a training accuracy of 99.6% (as same as the PCA + SVM method (99.6%)). Among the component maps fitting networks, we comprehensively compared the improved LeNet network, the improved AlexNet network, and the improved VGG11 network, and finally selected the improved VGG11 network as the component maps fitting network. In the improved VGG11 network training, we used the MSE loss function and cosine similarity to judge the merit of the model, and the MSE loss of the network training reached 4.6 x 10(-4) (characterizing the variability of the training results and the actual results), and we used the cosine similarity as the accuracy criterion, and the cosine similarity of the training results reached 0.99 (comparison of the training results and the actual results).

Early detection of cancerous cells is of vital importance in the lungs providing oxygen to the human body and excretion of carbon dioxide in the body as a result of vital activities. In this study, the detection of lung cancers is realized using LeNet, AlexNet and VGG-16 deep learning models. The experiments were carried out on an open dataset composed of Computed Tomography (CT) images. In the experiment, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used for feature extraction and classification purposes. In order to increase the success rate of the classification, the image augmentation techniques, such as cutting, zooming, horizontal turning and filling, were applied to the dataset during the training of the models. Because of the outstanding success of AlexNet model, the features obtained from the last fully-connected layer of the model were separately applied as the input to linear regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and softmax classifiers. A combination of AlexNet model and k NN classifier achieved the most efficient classification accuracy as 98.74 %. Then, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection method was applied to the deep feature set to choose the most efficient features. Consequently, the success rate was yielded as 99.51 % by reclassifying the dataset with the selected features and k NN model.

We adopt a data-driven approach to automatically determine the number of components of the model. In order to better extract robust features, we propose a framework of data-driven two-layer structure visual dictionary learning (DTSVDL). It works by dividing the visual dictionary structure learning into two levels: the attribute layer and the detail layer. In the attribute layer, the attributes of the image dataset are learned, and these attributes are obtained by a data-driven Bayesian nonparametric model. Then, in the detail layer, the detailed information over attributes is further explored and refined, and the attributes are weighted by the number of effective observations associated with each attribute. Our proposed approach has three main advantages: (1) the two-layer structure makes our building visual dictionary be more expressive; (2) the number of components in the attribute layer can be determined automatically from the data; (3) the components are automatically determined based on the scale of visual words; therefore, our model can well mitigate the overfitting problem. In addition, by comparing with stacked autoencoders, stacked denoising autoencoders, LeNet-5, speeded-up robust features, and pretrained deep learning model ImageNet-VGG-F algorithms, we find that our approach achieves satisfactory image categorization results on two benchmark datasets. Specifically, higher categorization performance is achieved than by the classical approaches on 15 scene categories and action datasets. We conclude that the resulting DTSVDL possesses a good generality derived from attribute information as well as an excellent distinction derived from detailed information. In other words, the visual dictionary learned by our algorithm is more expressive and discriminatory.

However, most existing methods still have difficulties in learning representative features from the raw data. In addition, they assume that the feature distribution of training data in source domain is the same as that of testing data in target domain, which is invalid in many real-world bearing fault diagnosis problems. Since deep learning has the automatic feature extraction ability and ensemble learning can improve the accuracy and generalization performance of classifiers, this paper proposes a novel bearing fault diagnosis method based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and random forest (RF) ensemble learning. Firstly, time domain vibration signals are converted into two dimensional (2D) gray-scale images containing abundant fault information by continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Secondly, a CNN model based on LeNet-5 is built to automatically extract multi-level features that are sensitive to the detection of faults from the images. Finally, the multi-level features containing both local and global information are utilized to diagnose bearing faults by the ensemble of multiple RF classifiers. In particular, low-level features containing local characteristics and accurate details in the hidden layers are combined to improve the diagnostic performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by two sets of bearing data collected from reliance electric motor and rolling mill, respectively.

Methods Deep learning methods are used to achieve automatic recognition of honeycomb lung in CT images, however, are time consuming and less accurate due to the large amount of structural parameters. In this paper, a novel recognition method based on MobileNetV1 network, multiscale feature fusion method (MSFF), and dilated convolution is explored to deal with honeycomb lung in CT image classification. Firstly, the dilated convolution with different dilated rate is used to extract features to obtain receptive fields of different sizes, and then fuse the features of different scales at multiscale feature fusion block is used to solve the problem of feature loss and incomplete feature extraction. After that, by using linear activation functions (Sigmoid) instead of nonlinear activation functions (ReLu) in the improved deep separable convolution blocks to retain the feature information of each channel. Finally, by reducing the number of improved deep separable blocks to reduce the computation and resource consumption of the model. Results The experimental results show that improved MobileNet model has the best performance and the potential for recognition of honeycomb lung image datasets, which includes 6318 images. By comparing with 4 traditional models (SVM, RF, decision tree, and KNN) and 11 deep learning models (LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet, ResNet18, DenseNet121, SENet18, InceptionV3, InceptionV4, Xception, and MobileNetV1), our model achieved the performance with an accuracy of 99.52%, a sensitivity of 99.35%, and a specificity of 99.89%. Conclusion Improved MobileNet model is designed for the automatic recognition and classification of honeycomb lung in CT images. Through experiments comparative analysis of other models of machine learning and deep learning, it is proved that the proposed improved MobileNet method has the best recognition accuracy with fewer the model parameters and less the calculation time.","[Li Gang; Zhang Ling] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Software, Taiyuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang Haixuan; Zhao Juming] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Informat & Comp, Taiyuan, Peoples R China; [E Linning] Shanxi Bethune Hosp, Taiyuan, Peoples R China; [Li Yu] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Data Sci, Taiyuan, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, L (corresponding author), Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Software, Taiyuan, Peoples R China.",zl2090@126.com,,,Shanxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation,Shanxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province),We thank the Shanxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation through a research grant.,,29,6,6,10,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0094-2405,2473-4209,,MED PHYS,Med.

Arrhythmia is any irregularity of the heartbeat that causes an abnormality in the heart rhythm. Early detection of arrhythmia has great importance to prevent many diseases. Manual analysis of ECG recordings is not practical for quickly identifying arrhythmias that may cause sudden deaths. Hence, many studies have been presented to develop computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) systems to automatically identify arrhythmias.Methods: This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach to identify arrhythmias in ECG signals. The proposed approach identifies arrhythmia classes using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained by two-dimensional (2D) ECG beat images. Firstly, ECG signals, which consist of 5 different arrhythmias, are segmented into heartbeats which are transformed into 2D grayscale images. Afterward, the images are used as input for training a new CNN architecture to classify heartbeats.Results: The experimental results show that the classification performance of the proposed approach reaches an overall accuracy of 99.7%, sensitivity of 99.7%, and specificity of 99.22% in the classification of five different ECG arrhythmias. Further, the proposed CNN architecture is compared to other popular CNN architectures such as LeNet and ResNet-50 to evaluate the performance of the study.Conclusions: Test results demonstrate that the deep network trained by ECG images provides outstanding classification performance of arrhythmic ECG signals and outperforms similar network architectures. Moreover, the proposed method has lower computational costs compared to existing methods and is more suitable for mobile device-based diagnosis systems as it does not involve any complex preprocessing process. Hence, the proposed approach provides a simple and robust automatic cardiac arrhythmia detection scheme for the classification of ECG arrhythmias.(c) 2021 AGBM. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

In this context, this article assesses three different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures along with three learning approaches to train them for hieroglyph classification, which is a very challenging task due to the limited availability of segmented ancient Maya glyphs. More precisely, the first approach, the baseline, relies on pretrained networks as feature extractor. The second one investigates a transfer learning method by fine-tuning a pretrained network for our glyph classification task. The third approach considers directly training networks from scratch with our glyph data. The merits of three different network architectures are compared: a generic sequential model (i.e., LeNet), a sketch-specific sequential network (i.e., Sketch-a-Net), and the recent Residual Networks. The sketch-specific model trained from scratch outperforms other models and training strategies. Even for a challenging 150-class classification task, this model achieves 70.3% average accuracy and proves itself promising in case of a small amount of cultural heritage shape data. Furthermore, we visualize the discriminative parts of glyphs with the recent Grad-CAM method, and demonstrate that the discriminative parts learned by the model agree, in general, with the expert annotation of the glyph specificity (diagnostic features). Finally, as a step toward systematic evaluation of these visualizations, we conduct a perceptual crowdsourcing study. Specifically, we analyze the interpretability of the representations from Sketch-a-Net and ResNet-50. Overall, our article takes two important steps toward providing tools to scholars in the digital humanities: increased performance for automation and improved interpretability of algorithms.","[Can, Gulcan; Odobez, Jean-Marc; Gatica-Perez, Daniel] Idiap Res Inst, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Can, Gulcan; Odobez, Jean-Marc; Gatica-Perez, Daniel] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Elect Engn, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland",,"Can, GC (corresponding author), Idiap Res Inst, Lausanne, Switzerland.;Can, GC (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Elect Engn, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.",gulcan.can@epfl.ch; odobez@idiap.ch; gatica@idiap.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation through the MAAYA project; Hasler Foundation through the DCrowdLens project,Swiss National Science Foundation through the MAAYA project; Hasler Foundation through the DCrowdLens project,This work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation through the MAAYA project and by the Hasler Foundation through the DCrowdLens project.,,46,5,5,2,17,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1556-4673,1556-4711,,ACM J COMPUT CULT HE,ACM J.

To this end, the research of CNN compression has recently become emerging. In this paper, we propose a novel filter pruning scheme, termed structured sparsity regularization (SSR), to simultaneously speed up the computation and reduce the memory overhead of CNNs, which can be well supported by various off-the-shelf deep learning libraries. Concretely, the proposed scheme incorporates two different regularizers of structured sparsity into the original objective function of filter pruning, which fully coordinates the global output and local pruning operations to adaptively prune filters. We further propose an alternative updating with Lagrange multipliers (AULM) scheme to efficiently solve its optimization. AULM follows the principle of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and alternates between promoting the structured sparsity of CNNs and optimizing the recognition loss, which leads to a very efficient solver (2.5x to the most recent work that directly solves the group sparsity-based regularization). Moreover, by imposing the structured sparsity, the online inference is extremely memory-light since the number of filters and the output feature maps are simultaneously reduced. The proposed scheme has been deployed to a variety of state-of-the-art CNN structures, including LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet, and GoogLeNet, over different data sets. Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the proposed compression scheme for the task of transfer learning, including domain adaptation and object detection, which also show exciting performance gains over the state-of-the-art filter pruning methods.","[Lin, Shaohui; Ji, Rongrong; Li, Yuchao] Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Fujian Key Lab Sensing & Comp Smart City, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Ji, Rongrong] Peng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Deng, Cheng] Xidian Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Xian 710071, Peoples R China; [Li, Xuelong] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Li, Xuelong] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Ctr OPT IMagery Anal & Learning OPTIMAL, Xian 710072, Peoples R China",,"Ji, RR (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Fujian Key Lab Sensing & Comp Smart City, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",rrji@xmu.edu.cn,,"Lin, Shaohui/0000-0003-0284-9940; Deng, Cheng/0000-0003-2620-3247","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0113000, 2016YFB1001503, 2018YFB1107400]; Natural Science Foundation of China [U1705262, 61772443, 61402388, 61572410, 61871470]; Postdoctoral Innovative Talent Support Program [BX201600094]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M612134]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China [2017J01125]","National Key R&D Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Postdoctoral Innovative Talent Support Program; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province)","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2017YFC0113000, Grant 2016YFB1001503, and Grant 2018YFB1107400, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U1705262, Grant 61772443, Grant 61402388, Grant 61572410, and Grant 61871470, in part by the Postdoctoral Innovative Talent Support Program under Grant BX201600094, in part by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant 2017M612134, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China, under Grant 2017J01125.",,71,46,48,7,21,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2162-237X,2162-2388,,IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR,IEEE Trans.

We trained CNN to classify either defective or good printed circuit board (PCB).

The CNN, which has 60 million parameters and 500,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and two globally connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax.

Sea clutter data are a nonlinear and recursive time series, and RPs provide qualitative analysis of nonlinear and recursive dynamic systems. Thus, we construct the RPs' datasets to extract the recursive feature of sea clutter. In the RPs' datasets, RPs' parameters, embedding delay tau and embedding dimension in, are obtained by the average mutual information (AMI) and false nearest neighbor (FNN) algorithms, respectively. In addition, to extract the local features of RPs, CNN is applied. CNN makes full use of local features of the datasets, has the advantages of translation invariance and strong generalization ability, and shares the available weights to simplify network structure. We implement a proper LeNet-5 CNN training on the constructed RPs datasets and verity it using intelligent PIXel (IPIX) processing radar measured datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that CNN successfully classifies the RPs of targets and clutter. Moreover, the feasibility of RPs-CNN is verified by seven aspects, i.e., accuracy, precision, false alarm, miss rate, recall, F1-measure, and Kappa. In addition, six parameters that may affect the classification performance are also analyzed, including time series length, embedding delay, embedding dimension, convolutional kernel size, kernel depth, and optimization function. The results indicate that the proposed RPs-CNN method can reach a 92.05% F1-measure and 87.19% Kappa which performs better than other classification methods. Meanwhile, the false alarm rate (FAR) of RPs-CNN is testified by FAC classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RPs-CNN significantly improves the detection probability over other classification detectors in low FAR cases.","[Shi, Yanling; Guo, Yaxing; Yao, Tingting; Liu, Zipeng] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Telecommun & Informat Engn, Nanjing 210003, Peoples R China",,"Shi, YL (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Telecommun & Informat Engn, Nanjing 210003, Peoples R China.",ylshi@njupt.edu.cn; guoyaaxing@qq.com; 1219012935@njupt.edu.cn; 1218012603@njupt.edu.cn,"Guo, Yaxing/GSE-6242-2022","Guo, Yaxing/0000-0001-7173-1706",,,,,44,0,0,1,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0196-2892,1558-0644,,IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE,IEEE Trans.

Surface flaws not only affect the appearance, but also affect the efficiency of the workpiece and reduce the safety of the product. Therefore, the appearance of the product needs to be inspected to determine if there are surface defects, such as scratches, dirt, chipped objects, etc., after production is completed. The traditional manual comparison inspection method is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but human error is also unavoidable when inspecting thousands or tens of thousands of products. Therefore, Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) is often used today. The traditional AOI algorithm does not fully meet the subtle detection requirements and needs to import a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), but the common deep residual networks are too large, such as ResNet-101, ResNet-152, DarkNet-19, and DarkNet-53. Therefore, this research proposes an improved customized convolutional neural network. We used a self-built convolutional neural network model to detect the defects on the metal's surface. Grad-CAM was used to display the result of the last layer of convolution as the basis for judging whether it was OK or NG. The self-designed CNN network architecture could be customized and adjusted without using a large network model. The customized network model designed in this study was compared with LeNet, VGG-19, ResNet-34, DarkNet-19, and DarkNet-53 after training five times each. The experimental results show that the self-built customized deep learning model avoiding the use of pooling and fully connected layers can effectively improve the recognition rate of defective samples and unqualified samples, and reduce the training cost. Our custom-designed models have great advantages over other models.

However, most of these studies focus on single-device-based inference, but horizontally collaborative inference in state-of-the-art systems, like intelligent edge services in self-driving cars, voice controllable systems, and drones, nullify most of these analyses. Horizontal collaboration implies partitioning the trained CNN models or CNN tasks to multiple end devices or edge nodes. Therefore, it is imperative to examine the robustness of the CapsNet against malicious attacks when deployed in horizontally collaborative environments. Towards this, we examine the robustness of the CapsNet when subjected to noise-based inference attacks in a horizontal collaborative environment. In this analysis, we perturbed the feature maps of the different layers of four DNN models, i.e., CapsNet, mini-VGGNet, LeNet, and an in-house designed CNN (ConvNet) with the same number of parameters as CapsNet, using two types of noised-based attacks, i.e., Gaussian Noise Attack and FGSM noise attack. The experimental results show that similar to the traditional CNNs, depending upon the attacker's access to the DNN layer, the classification accuracy of the CapsNet drops significantly. For example, when Gaussian Noise Attack classification is performed at the Digit-cap layer of the CapsNet, the maximum classification accuracy drop is approximately 97%. Similarly, the maximum classification accuracy drop is 90.1 % when an FGSM noise attack is performed at the Cony layer of the CapsNet.","[Adeyemo, Adewale; Odetola, Tolulope; Hasan, Syed Rafay] Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA; [Khalid, Faiq] Vienna Univ Technol, Dept Comp Engn, A-1040 Vienna, Austria",,"Adeyemo, A (corresponding author), Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA.",,,,,,,,18,1,1,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1548-3746,1558-3899,978-1-6654-2461-5,MIDWEST SYMP CIRCUIT,,,2021.0,,,,,,,1074,1077,,10.1109/MWSCAS47672.2021.9531833,0.0,,,4,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Engineering,BS9ZN,,Green Submitted,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000784758700248,0

This results in significant memory requirements as well as a computational burden. Consequently, there is a growing need for filter-level pruning approaches for compressing CNN based models that not only reduce the total number of parameters but reduce the overall computation as well. We present a new min-max framework for the filter-level pruning of CNNs. Our framework jointly prunes and fine-tunes CNN model parameters, with an adaptive pruning rate, while maintaining the model's predictive performance. Our framework consists of two modules: (1) An adaptive filter pruning (AFP) module, which minimizes the number of filters in the model; and (2) A pruning rate controller (PRC) module, which maximizes the accuracy during pruning. In addition, we also introduce orthogonality regularization in training of CNNs to reduce redundancy across filters of a particular layer. In the proposed approach, we prune the least important filters and, at the same time, reduce the redundancy level in the model by using orthogonality constraints during training. Moreover, unlike most previous approaches, our approach allows directly specifying the desired error tolerance instead of the pruning level. We perform extensive experiments for object classification (LeNet, VGG, MobileNet, and ResNet) and object detection (SSD, and Faster-RCNN) over benchmarked datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, GTSDB, ImageNet, and MS-COCO. We also present several ablation studies to validate the proposed approach. Our compressed models can be deployed at run-time, without requiring any special libraries or hardware. Our approach reduces the number of parameters of VGG-16 by an impressive factor of 17.5X, and the number of FLOPS by 6.43X, with no loss of accuracy, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art filter pruning methods.","[Singh, Pravendra; Verma, Vinay Kumar; Rai, Piyush; Namboodiri, Vinay P.] IIT Kanpur, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Singh, P (corresponding author), IIT Kanpur, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.",psingh@cse.iitk.ac.in; vkverma@cse.iitk.ac.in; piyush@cse.iitk.ac.in; vinaypn@cse.iitk.ac.in,"Verma, Vinay/ABA-9275-2020; Singh, Pravendra/ABC-9247-2020","Singh, Pravendra/0000-0003-1001-2219; Namboodiri, Vinay/0000-0001-5262-9722",,,,,42,9,9,1,11,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1932-4553,1941-0484,,IEEE J-STSP,IEEE J.

Even though CNN inference is notoriously compute-intensive, as convolutions account for >90% of the total operation tasks, the ability to tradeoff between accuracy, performance, power, and latency to meet target application makes it an open research topic. This paper proposes the Spatial Locality Input Data (SLID) method for computational reuse during the inference stage for a pre-trained network. The method exploits input data spatial locality via skipping partial processing of the multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations for adjacent data and equating its value to previously computed ones. SLID improves the throughput of resource-constrained devices (Internet-of-Things, edge devices) and accelerates computations during the inference phase by reducing the number of MAC operations. Such approximate computing schema does not require a similarity quantification step nor any modification for the training stage. The computational data reuse was evaluated on three well-known distinctive CNN structures and data sets with alternating layer selections: LeNet, CIFAR-10, and AlexNet. The computational data reuse method saves up to 34.9%, 49.84%, and 31.5% of MAC operations while reducing the accuracy by 8%, 3.7%, and 5.0% for the three models mentioned earlier, respectively. Besides, the proposed method saves on memory access by eliminating data fetching of skipped inputs. Furthermore, filter size, strides, and padding on the accuracy and savings of operations are analyzed. SLID is the first work to exploit the input spatial locality for savings on CNN convolution operations with minimal accuracy loss and without memory or computational overhead. This makes it a great option to support intelligence at the edge.","[Alantali, Fatmah; Halawani, Yasmin; Mohammad, Baker; Al-Qutayri, Mahmoud] Khalifa Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Syst On Chip Ctr SoCC, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",,"Mohammad, B (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Syst On Chip Ctr SoCC, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",baker.mohammad@ku.ac.ae,"Mohammad, Baker/E-6470-2014; Al-Qutayri, Mahmoud/P-7632-2016","Mohammad, Baker/0000-0002-6063-473X; Al-Qutayri, Mahmoud/0000-0002-9600-8036","Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, through the CIRA Project [CIRA-2018-026]; System-on-Chip Center [RC2-2018-020]","Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, through the CIRA Project; System-on-Chip Center","This work was supported in part by the Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, through the CIRA Project under Grant CIRA-2018-026 and the System-on-Chip Center under Grant RC2-2018-020.",,33,1,1,2,6,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021.0,9,,,,,,57179,57187,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3071409,0.0,,,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,RP8AW,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000641947000001,0

Combining physical methods and deep learning models to divide the pollution process of PM2.5 into effective multiple types is necessary to achieve a reliable prediction of the PM2.5 value. Therefore, a candlestick chart sample generator was designed to generate the candlestick chart from the online PM2.5 continuous monitoring data of the Guilin monitoring station site. After these generated candlestick charts were analyzed through the Gaussian diffusion model, it was found that the characteristics of the physical transmission process of PM2.5 pollutants can be reflected. Based on a set three-day period, using the time linear convolution method, 2188 sets of candlestick chart data were obtained from the 2013-2018 PM2.5 concentration data. There existed 16 categories generated by unsupervised classification that met the established classification judgment standards. After the statistical analysis, it was found that the accuracy rate of the change trend of these classifications reached 99.68% during the next period. Using the candlestick chart data as the training dataset, the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) model, an improved convolutional neural network model, was used for the classification. The experimental results showed that the overall accuracy (OA) value of the candlestick chart combination classification was 96.19%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.960. IN the VGG model, the overall accuracy was improved by 1.93%, on average, compared with the support vector machines (SVM), LeNet, and AlexNet models. According to the experimental results, using the VGG classification method to classify continuous pollution data in the form of candlestick charts can more comprehensively retain the characteristics of the physical pollution process and provide a classification basis for accurately predicting PM2.5 values. At the same time, the statistical feasibility of this method has been proved.","[Xu, Rui; Pan, Xipeng] Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Informat Secur, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaoming; Li, Jian] Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Wan, Hang] Guangdong Univ Technol, Inst Environm & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, Key Lab City Cluster Environm Safety & Green Dev, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China",,"Wan, H (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Technol, Inst Environm & Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, Key Lab City Cluster Environm Safety & Green Dev, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.",xur@guet.edu.cn; mingluobanhua@163.com; wanhang@gdut.edu.cn; pxp201@bupt.edu.cn; lijian@guet.edu.cn,,,State-supported Special Fund Project for Local Science and Technology Development [ZY1949005]; Guangxi Key Research and Development Program [AB18221108]; Guilin Key Scientific Research and Technological Development Program [20190213-1]; Innovation Project of GUET Graduate Education [2020YCXS100],State-supported Special Fund Project for Local Science and Technology Development; Guangxi Key Research and Development Program; Guilin Key Scientific Research and Technological Development Program; Innovation Project of GUET Graduate Education,This work was supported by the State-supported Special Fund Project for Local Science and Technology Development (grant number ZY1949005); the Guangxi Key Research and Development Program (grant number AB18221108); the Guilin Key Scientific Research and Technological Development Program (grant number 20190213-1); the Innovation Project of GUET Graduate Education (grant number 2020YCXS100).,,57,1,1,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,MAY,2021.0,12,5,,,,,,,570,10.3390/atmos12050570,0.0,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,SG5LW,,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000653482600001,0

This paper proposes an approach focusing on scalable CIM designs using a new ten-transistor (10T) static random access memory (SRAM) bit-cell. Using the proposed 10T SRAM bit-cell, we present two SRAM-based CIM (SRAM-CIM) macros supporting multibit and binary MAC operations. The first design achieves fully parallel computing and high throughput using 32 parallel binary MAC operations. Advanced circuit techniques such as an input-dependent dynamic reference generator and an input-boosted sense amplifier are presented. Fabricated in 28 nm CMOS process, this design achieves 409.6 GOPS throughput, 1001.7 TOPS/W energy efficiency, and a 169.9 TOPS/mm(2) throughput area efficiency. The proposed approach effectively solves previous problems such as writing disturb, throughput, and the power consumption of an analog to digital converter (ADC). The second design supports multibit MAC operation (4-b weight, 4-b input, and 8-b output) to increase the inference accuracy. We propose an architecture that divides 4-b weight and 4-b input multiplication to four 2-b multiplication in parallel, which increases the signal margin by 16x compared to conventional 4-b multiplication. Besides, the capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) area issue is effectively addressed using the intrinsic bit-line capacitance existing in the SRAM-CIM architecture. The proposed approach of realizing four 2-b parallel multiplication using the CDAC is successfully demonstrated with a modified LeNet-5 neural network. These results demonstrate that the proposed 10T bit-cell is promising for realizing robust and scalable SRAM-CIM designs, which is essential for realizing fully parallel edge computing.","[Nguyen, Van Truong; Lee, Jong-Wook] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Elect & Informat Convergence Engn, Informat & Commun Syst Chip SoC Res Ctr, Yongin 17104, South Korea; [Kim, Jie-Seok; Lee, Jong-Wook] Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Elect & Informat, Dept Elect, Yongin 17104, South Korea",,"Lee, JW (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Elect & Informat Convergence Engn, Informat & Commun Syst Chip SoC Res Ctr, Yongin 17104, South Korea.;Lee, JW (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Elect & Informat, Dept Elect, Yongin 17104, South Korea.",jwlee@khu.ac.kr,,"gim, jiseog/0000-0003-3420-1145",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea [2021R1A2B5B01001475]; National Research and Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Science and ICT [2020M3H2A1076786],Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); National Research and Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Science and ICT(National Research Foundation of Korea),"This work was supported in part by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea under Grant 2021R1A2B5B01001475, and in part by National Research and Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT under Grant 2020M3H2A1076786.",,37,1,1,1,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2021.0,9,,,,,,71262,71276,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3079425,0.0,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,SE4HQ,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000652034300001,0

Multi-modal imaging such as structural MRI and DTI provide useful information for the classification of patients on the basis of brain biomarkers. Recently, CNN methods have emerged as powerful tools to improve classification using images. New Method: In this paper, we propose a transfer learning scheme using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify brain scans focusing only on a small ROI: e.g. a few slices of the hippocampal region. The network's architecture is similar to a LeNet-like CNN upon which models are built and fused for AD stage classification diagnosis. We evaluated various types of transfer learning through the following mechanisms: (i) cross-modal (sMRI and DTI) and (ii) cross-domain transfer learning (using MNIST) (iii) a hybrid transfer learning of both types. Results: Our method shows good performances even on small datasets and with a limited number of slices of small brain region. It increases accuracy with more than 5 points for the most difficult classification tasks, i.e., AD/MCI and MCI/NC. Comparison with Existing Method(s): Our methodology provides good accuracy scores for classification over a shallow convolutional network. Besides, we focused only on a small region; i.e., the hippocampal region, where few slices are selected to feed the network. Also, we used cross-modal transfer learning. Conclusions: Our proposed method is suitable for working with a shallow CNN network for low-resolution MRI and DTI scans. It yields to significant results even if the model is trained on small datasets, which is often the case in medical image analysis.","[Aderghal, Karim; Benois-Pineau, Jenny] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, Bordeaux INP, LaBRI,UMR 5800, F-33400 Talence, France; [Aderghal, Karim; Afdel, Karim] Ibn Zohr Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Sci, LabSIV, Agadir, Morocco; [Catheline, Gwenaelle] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR 5287, Inst Neurosci Cognit & Integrat Aquitaine INCIA, Bordeaux, France",,"Aderghal, K (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, Bordeaux INP, LaBRI,UMR 5800, F-33400 Talence, France.",karim.aderghal@u-bordeaux.fr,,"Catheline, Gwenaelle/0000-0003-1949-8913; Benois-Pineau, Jenny/0000-0003-0659-8894; ADERGHAL, Karim/0000-0002-2927-5265","Franco-Moroccan TOUBKAL Research Grant AlClass [BK/16/23]; LaBRI, University of Bordeaux/CNRS/Bordeaux-INP","Franco-Moroccan TOUBKAL Research Grant AlClass; LaBRI, University of Bordeaux/CNRS/Bordeaux-INP","This work was supported by The Franco-Moroccan TOUBKAL Research Grant AlClass, Project Code No BK/16/23, and the LaBRI, University of Bordeaux/CNRS/Bordeaux-INP.",,66,15,15,5,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,2405-8440,,HELIYON,Heliyon,DEC,2020.0,6,12,,,,,,,e05652,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05652,0.0,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,PQ8PF,33336093.0,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000606804700013,0

There are numerous fish species and due to their close resemblance with each other, it is difficult to classify them by external characters. Recently, computer vision and deep learning-based identification of different animal species is being widely used by the researchers. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most analytically powerful tools in deep learning architecture for the image classification based on visual features. This work aims to propose a deep learning framework based on the CNN method for fish species identification. The proposed CNN architecture contains 32 deep layers that are considerably deep to derive valuable and discriminating features from the image. The deep supervision is inflicted on the VGGNet architecture to increase the classification performance by instantly adding four convolutional layers to the training of each level in the network. To test the performance of proposed 32-Layer CNN architecture, we developed a dataset termed as Fish-Pak and is publicly available at Mendeley data (Fish-Pak: https://doi.org/10.17632/n3ydw29sbz.3#folder-6b024354-bae3-460a-a758-352685ba0e38) .

To ensure the superior performance of proposed CNN architecture, we have carried out the experimental comparison with other deep learning frameworks involving VGG-16 for transfer learning, one block VGG, two block VGG, three block VGG, LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet-50 on the Fish-Pak data set.

This uniquely enables the execution of a broad set of workloads, ranging from storage, subsequent signal processing, and pre-conditioning or feature extraction to final convolutional neural network (CNN) computations. The ability to handle arbitrary input/weight sign in any operand within the same array and the same access cycle enables true end-to-end data locality, preserving the inherent benefits of in-memory computing along the entire signal chain. The proposed broad-purpose computing SRAM is based on a commercial 8T dual-port bitcell, and its simplicity allows the enhanced periphery to be pitch-matched with the array, making it amenable for automated design via memory compilers. The +/- CIM pipelined architecture allows concurrent read/write and compute operations, avoiding the traditional memory unavailability in compute mode for improved throughput and easier system integration. A 40-nm test chip demonstrating the +/- CIM architecture with adjustable input/weight precision exhibits an energy efficiency up to 41 TOPS/W, at an area (energy) overhead of 38% (25%) and negligible performance overhead compared to a compiled SRAM baseline. The sub-LSB computation mean-squared error associated with mismatch (0.38 LSB) and temporal noise (0.62 LSB) confirms the inherent robustness of the architecture. When used for neural network tasks (LeNet-5 and VGG), the accuracy drop is kept between 0.3% and 3.4%, compared to a double-precision software implementation.

However, due to the complex and diverse video scenes, traffic data extraction from original videos is a sophisticated and difficult task, and corresponding algorithms are of high complexity and calculation cost. To reduce the algorithm complexity and subsequent computation cost, this study proposed an autoencoder model which effectively reduces the video dimension by optimizing structural parameters; thus several traffic recognition models can conduct image processing work based on dimension-reduced videos. Firstly, an optimal autoencoder model A* with five hidden layers was constructed. Then, it was combined with a linear classifier, support vector machine, deep neural network, DNN linear classification method, and the k-means clustering method; thus, five traffic state recognition models were constructed: A*-Linear, A*-SVM, A*-DNN, A*-DNN Linear, and A*-k-means. Train and test results show that the accuracy rate and recall rate of A*-linear, A*-SVM, A*-DNN, and A*-DNN Linear were 94.5%-97.1%, and the F1 score was 94.4%-97.1%; besides, the accuracy rate, recall rate, and F1 score of A*-k-means were all approximately 95%, which suggests that the combination of the autoencoder A* and common classification or clustering methods achieve good recognition performance. Comparison was also implemented among the five models proposed above and four CNN-based models such as AlexNet, LeNet, GoogLeNet, and VGG16, which shows that the five proposed modes achieve F1 scores of 94.4%-97.1%, while the four CNN-based models achieve F1 scores of 16.7%-94%, indicating that the proposed light weight design methods outperform more complex CNN-based models in traffic state recognition.","[Cai, Xiaoyu; Jing, Qiongli; Peng, Bo; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Wang, Yuting; Tang, Ju] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Coll Traff & Transportat, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China",,"Peng, B (corresponding author), Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Coll Traff & Transportat, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China.",pengbo351@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61703064]; Chongqing Research Program [cstc2018jscx-msybX0295]; Scientific Research Project of Chongqing Key Lab of Traffic System & Safety in Mountain Cities [2018TSSMC05],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chongqing Research Program; Scientific Research Project of Chongqing Key Lab of Traffic System & Safety in Mountain Cities,"This research was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant 61703064, Chongqing Research Program under grant cstc2018jscx-msybX0295, and Scientific Research Project of Chongqing Key Lab of Traffic System & Safety in Mountain Cities under grant 2018TSSMC05.",,32,0,0,3,3,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1024-123X,1563-5147,,MATH PROBL ENG,Math.

While several methods have been proposed to solve this problem, we propose a novel strategy for solving the same that is orthogonal to the strategies proposed so far. We hypothesize that if we add a fatuous auxiliary task, to a network which aims to solve a semantic task such as classification or detection, the filters devoted to solving this frivolous task would not be relevant for solving the main task of concern. These filters could be pruned and pruning these would not reduce the performance on the original task. We demonstrate that this strategy is not only successful, it in fact allows for improved performance for a variety of tasks such as object classification, detection and action recognition. An interesting observation is that the task needs to be fatuous so that any semantically meaningful filters would not be relevant for solving this task. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed approach on different architectures (LeNet, VGG-16, ResNet, Faster RCNN, SSD-512, C3D, and MobileNet V2) and datasets (MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, GTSDB, COCO, and UCF101) and demonstrate its generalizability through extensive experiments. Moreover, our compressed models can be used at run-time without requiring any special libraries or hardware. Our model compression method reduces the number of FLOPS by an impressive factor of 6.03X and GPU memory footprint by more than 17X for VGG-16, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art filter pruning methods. We demonstrate the usability of our approach for 3D convolutions and various vision tasks such as object classification, object detection, and action recognition. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, despite only enforcing a single robustness criterion, its performance scales poorly with dataset complexity. On CIFAR10, a non-robust LeNet model has a 21.63% error rate, while a model created using verifiable training and a L-infinity robustness criterion of 8/255, has an error rate of 57.10%. Upon examination, we find that when labeling visually similar classes, the model's error rate is as high as 61.65%. Thus, we attribute the loss in performance to inter-class similarity. Classes that are similar (i.e., close in the feature space) increase the difficulty of learning a robust model. While it may be desirable to train a model to be robust for a large robustness region, pairwise class similarities limit the potential gains. Furthermore, consideration must be made regarding the relative cost of mistaking one class for another. In security or safety critical tasks, similar classes are likely to belong to the same group, and thus are equally sensitive. In this work, we propose a new approach that utilizes interclass similarity to improve the performance of verifiable training and create robust models with respect to multiple adversarial criteria. First, we cluster similar classes using agglomerate clustering and assign robustness criteria based on the degree of similarity between clusters. Next, we propose two methods to apply our approach: (1) the Inter-Group Robustness Prioritization method, which uses a custom loss term to create a single model with multiple robustness guarantees and (2) the neural decision tree method, which trains multiple sub-classifiers with different robustness guarantees and combines them in a decision tree architecture. Our experiments on Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate that by prioritizing the robustness between the most dissimilar groups, we improve clean performance by up to 9.63% and 30.89% respectively. Furthermore, on CIFAR100, our approach reduces the clean error rate by 26.32%.","[Wang, Shiqi] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Eykholt, Kevin; Lee, Taesung; Jang, Jiyong; Molloy, Ian] IBM Res, Armonk, NY USA",,"Wang, SQ (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",tcwangshiqi@cs.columbia.edu; kheykholt@ibm.com; Taesung.Lee@ibm.com; jjang@us.ibm.com; molloyim@us.ibm.com,,,,,,,32,0,0,1,1,ASSOC ADVANCEMENT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,PALO ALTO,"2275 E BAYSHORE RD, STE 160, PALO ALTO, CA 94303 USA",2159-5399,2374-3468,978-1-57735-866-4,AAAI CONF ARTIF INTE,,,2021.0,35,,,,,,10201,10209,,,,,,9,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education, Scientific Disciplines",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Education & Educational Research,BS0DR,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000681269801099,0

However, traditional image processing methods cannot handle it well due to the uncertainty of manually extracted features. Therefore, a lightweight and reliable artificial neural network model is proposed to classify and identify our objective. To solve this problem, a wood knot defect recognition model named SE-ResNet18 combining convolutional neural network, attention mechanism, and transfer learning is proposed in this paper. First, the Sequence-and-Exception (SE) module is combined with Basicblock and is constructed as two modules called RBBSE-1 and RBBSE-2. These modules learn to enhance features that are useful for the current task, suppress useless features, and fuse the output features with the original features. Then, the fully connected layer is replaced with a global average pooling layer, which can effectively reduce the parameters of the fully connected layer in the model. Finally, a SE-ResNet18 was constructed by one convolutional layer, five RBBSE-1 modules, and three RBBSE-2 modules of different channels. The SE-ResNet18 has a higher accuracy (98.85%) in the test set compared to the unimproved model ResNet-18. Compared with the previously proposed ReSENet-18, more SE modules are used in SE-ResNet18 to provide a basis for future training on a larger-scale dataset. Based on the same test set, a comparison with other classical models (such as LeNet-5, AlexNet, etc.) was conducted, and the results validated the superiority of the proposed model. The proposed model achieves the expected objective and provides a new way of thinking for non-destructive testing of wood.

Recently, PPML has seen a visible shift towards the adoption of the Secure Outsourced Computation (SOC) paradigm due to the heavy computation that it entails. In the SOC paradigm, computation is outsourced to a set of powerful and specially equipped servers that provide service on a pay-per-use basis. In this work, we propose SWIFT, a robust PPML framework for a range of ML algorithms in SOC setting, that guarantees output delivery to the users irrespective of any adversarial behaviour. Robustness, a highly desirable feature, evokes user participation without the fear of denial of service. At the heart of our framework lies a highly-efficient, maliciously-secure, three-party computation (3PC) over rings that provides guaranteed output delivery (GOD) in the honestmajority setting. To the best of our knowledge, SWIFT is the first robust and efficient PPML framework in the 3PC setting. SWIFT is as fast as (and is strictly better in some cases than) the best-known 3PC framework BLAZE (Patra et al. NDSS'20), which only achieves fairness. We extend our 3PC framework for four parties (4PC). In this regime, SWIFT is as fast as the best known fair 4PC framework Trident (Chaudhari et al. NDSS'20) and twice faster than the best-known robust 4PC framework FLASH (Byali et al. PETS'20). We demonstrate our framework's practical relevance by benchmarking popular ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression and deep Neural Networks such as VGG16 and LeNet, both over a 64-bit ring in a WAN setting. For deep NN, our results testify to our claims that we provide improved security guarantee while incurring no additional overhead for 3PC and obtaining 2x improvement for 4PC.","[Koti, Nishat; Pancholi, Mahak; Patra, Arpita; Suresh, Ajith] Indian Inst Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India",,"Koti, N (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",,"Suresh, Ajith/AAE-8191-2022","Suresh, Ajith/0000-0002-5164-7758",Cisco PhD Fellowship 2020; Cisco MTech Fellowship 2020; SERB MATRICS (Theoretical Sciences) Grant 2020; Google India AI/ML Research Award 2020; Google PhD Fellowship 2019; Google Cloud,Cisco PhD Fellowship 2020; Cisco MTech Fellowship 2020; SERB MATRICS (Theoretical Sciences) Grant 2020; Google India AI/ML Research Award 2020(Google Incorporated); Google PhD Fellowship 2019(Google Incorporated); Google Cloud(Google Incorporated),"We thank our shepherd Guevara Noubir, and anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback.; Nishat Koti would like to acknowledge financial support from Cisco PhD Fellowship 2020.

It is very important to accurately and rapidly identifying and monitoring Ipomoea cairica (L.) sweets in the wild for managements taking the necessary strategies to control the Ipomoea cairica (L.) sweets to rapidly grow in the wild. However, current approaches mainly depend on manual identification, which result in high cost and low efficiency. Satellite and manned aircraft are feasible assisting approaches, but the quality of the images collected by them is not well since the ground sampling resolution is low and cloud exists. In this study, we present a novel identifying and monitoring framework and method for Ipomoea cairica (L.) sweets based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and artificial intelligence (AI). In the proposed framework, we low-costly collected the images with 8256 x 5504 pixels of the monitoring area by the UAV and the collected images are split into more small sub-images with 224 x 224 pixels for identifying model. For identifying Ipomoea cairica (L.) sweets, we also proposed a novel deep convolutional neural network which includes 12 layers.

During the last five years, the development of Hardware Description Language (HDL)-based CNN accelerators, either for FPGA or ASIC, has seen huge academic interest due to their high-performance and room for optimizations. Towards this direction, we propose a library-based framework, which extends TensorFlow, the well-established machine learning framework, and automatically generates high-throughput CNN inference engines for FPGAs and ASICs. The framework allows software developers to exploit the benefits of FPGA/ASIC acceleration without requiring any expertise on HDL development and low-level design. Moreover, it provides a set of optimization knobs concerning the model architecture and the inference engine generation, allowing the developer to tune the accelerator according to the requirements of the respective use case. Our framework is evaluated by optimizing the LeNet CNN model on the MNIST dataset, and implementing FPGA- and ASIC-based accelerators using the generated inference engine. The optimal FPGA-based accelerator on Zynq-7000 delivers 93% less memory footprint and 54% less Look-Up Table (LUT) utilization, and up to 10x speedup on the inference execution vs. different Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) implementations of the same model, in exchange for a negligible accuracy loss, i.e., 0.89%.

Pre-trained models may be stolen or abused by illegal users without the permission of the model owner. Recently, many works have been proposed to protect the intellectual property of DNN models. Among these works, embedding watermarks into DNN based on backdoor is one of the widely used methods. However, the backdoor-based watermark faces the risk of being detected or removed by an adversary. In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect and remove backdoor-based watermark in deep neural networks via generative adversarial networks (GAN). The proposed attack method consists of two phases. In the first phase, we use the GAN and few clean images to detect the watermarked class and reverse the watermark trigger in a DNN model. In the second phase, we fine-tune the watermarked DNN with the reversed backdoor images to remove the backdoor watermark. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method can effectively remove watermarks in DNN models, as the watermark retention rates of the watermarked LeNet-5 and ResNet-18 models reduce from 99.99% to 1.2% and from 99.99% to 1.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed attack only introduces a very slight influence on the performance of the DNN model. The test accuracy of the watermarked DNN on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets drops by only 0.77% and 2.67%, respectively. Compared with existing watermark removal works, the proposed attack can successfully remove the backdoor-based DNN watermarking with fewer data, and can reverse the watermark trigger and the watermark class from the DNN model.","[Sun, Shichang; Wang, Haoqi; Xue, Mingfu; Zhang, Yushu; Wang, Jian] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China; [Liu, Weiqiang] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China",,"Xue, MF (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China.",sunshichang@nuaa.edu.cn; haoqi.wang@nuaa.edu.cn; mingfu.xue@nuaa.edu.cn; yushu@nuaa.edu.cn; wangjian@nuaa.edu.cn; liuweiqiang@nuaa.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [61602241],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61602241).,,30,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-91356-4; 978-3-030-91355-7,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2021.0,13118,,,,,,341,357,,10.1007/978-3-030-91356-4_18,0.0,,,17,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BS7UK,,Green Submitted,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000767940700018,0

For the task of automated diagnosis, there should be flexibility to deal with an enormous amount of data represented in the form of medical images. In addition, efficient algorithms that could be adapted according to the nature of images should be used. The importance of automated medical diagnosis has been maximized with the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 first appeared in China, Wuhan, and then it has exploded in the whole world with a very bad impact on our daily life. The third wave of COVID-19 in the third world is really a disaster in current days, especially with the emergence of the delta variant of COVID-19 that is widespread. Required inspections should be carried out to monitor the COVID-19 spread in daily life and allow primary diagnosis of suspected cases, and long-term clinical laboratory monitoring. Healthcare professionals or radiologists can exploit AI (Artificial Intelligence) tools to quickly and reliably identify the cases of COVID-19. This paper introduces a DCNN (Deep Convolutional Neural Network) framework for chest X-ray and CT image classification based on TL (Transfer Learning). The objective is to perform multi-class and binary classification of the images in order to determine pneumonia and COVID-19 case. The TL is feasible, when using a small dataset by transferring knowledge from natural image classification to medical image classification. Two types of TL are used. The first type is fine-tuning of the DenseNet121, Densenet169, DenseNet201, ResNet50, ResNet152, VGG16, and VGG19 models. The second type is deep tuning of the LeNet-5, AlexNet, Inception naive v1, and VGG16 models. Extensive tests have been carried out on datasets of chest X-ray and CT images with different training/testing ratios of 80%:20%, 70%:30%, and 60%:40%. Experimental results on 9,270 chest X-ray ray and 2,762 chest CT images acquired from different institutions show that the TL is effective with an average accuracy of 98.49%.","[El-Shafai, Walid; Abd El-Samie, Fathi E.] Menoufia Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Commun, Fac Elect Engn, Menoufia, Egypt; [Algarni, Abeer D.; Abd El-Samie, Fathi E.; Soliman, Naglaa F.] Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Dept Informat Technol, Riyadh 84428, Saudi Arabia; [El Banby, Ghada M.] Menoufia Univ, Fac Elect Engn, Dept Ind Elect & Control Engn, Menoufia, Egypt; [Soliman, Naglaa F.] Zagazig Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Zagazig 44519, Egypt",,"Algarni, AD (corresponding author), Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Dept Informat Technol, Riyadh 84428, Saudi Arabia.",adalqarni@pnu.edu.sa,,,"Deputyship for Research & Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia [PNUDRI-Targeted-20-027]","Deputyship for Research & Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deputyship for Research & Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia for funding this research work through the Project Number (PNUDRI-Targeted-20-027).",,25,3,3,5,24,TECH SCIENCE PRESS,HENDERSON,"871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA",1079-8587,2326-005X,,INTELL AUTOM SOFT CO,Intell.

The most dangerous and deadly type of leukemia is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is diagnosed by hematologists and experts in blood and bone marrow samples using a high-quality microscope with a magnifying lens. Manual diagnosis, however, is considered slow and is limited by the differing opinions of experts and other factors. Thus, this work aimed to develop diagnostic systems for two Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Databases (ALL_IDB1 and ALL_IDB2) for the early detection of leukemia. All images were optimized before being introduced to the systems by two overlapping filters: the average and Laplacian filters. This study consists of three proposed systems as follows: the first consists of the artificial neural network (ANN), feed forward neural network (FFNN), and support vector machine (SVM), all of which are based on hybrid features extracted using Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Fuzzy Color Histogram (FCH) methods. Both ANN and FFNN reached an accuracy of 100%, while SVM reached an accuracy of 98.11%. The second proposed system consists of the convolutional neural network (CNN) models: AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet-18, based on the transfer learning method, in which deep feature maps were extracted and classified with high accuracy. All the models obtained promising results for the early detection of leukemia in both datasets, with an accuracy of 100% for the AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet-18 models. The third proposed system consists of hybrid CNN-SVM technologies, consisting of two blocks: CNN models for extracting feature maps and the SVM algorithm for classifying feature maps. All the hybrid systems achieved promising results, with AlexNet + SVM achieving 100% accuracy, Goog-LeNet + SVM achieving 98.1% accuracy, and ResNet-18 + SVM achieving 100% accuracy.","[Abunadi, Ibrahim] Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Dept Informat Syst, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia; [Senan, Ebrahim Mohammed] Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Aurangabad 431004, Maharashtra, India",,"Abunadi, I (corresponding author), Prince Sultan Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Dept Informat Syst, Riyadh 11586, Saudi Arabia.;Senan, EM (corresponding author), Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Aurangabad 431004, Maharashtra, India.",iabunadi@psu.edu.sa; senan1710@gmail.com,"; Abunadi, Ibrahim/D-8151-2014","Mohammed Senan, Ebrahim/0000-0002-7508-7601; Abunadi, Ibrahim/0000-0002-2546-2450",,,,,46,6,6,6,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,FEB,2022.0,22,4,,,,,,,1629,10.3390/s22041629,0.0,,,31,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,ZR7SF,35214531.0,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-10-10,WOS:000767978700001,0

However, these architectures are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: inputs crafted carefully to force the system output to a wrong label. Since machine-learning is being deployed in safety- critical and security-sensitive domains, such attacks may have catastrophic security and safety consequences. In this paper, we propose for the first time to use hardware-supported approximate computing to improve the robustness of machine learning classifiers. We show that our approximate computing implementation achieves robustness across a wide range of attack scenarios. Specifically, we show that successful adversarial attacks against the exact classifier have poor transferability to the approximate implementation. The transferability is even poorer for the black-box attack scenarios, where adversarial attacks are generated using a proxy model. Surprisingly, the robustness advantages also apply to white-box attacks where the attacker has unrestricted access to the approximate classifier implementation: in this case, we show that substantially higher levels of adversarial noise are needed to produce adversarial examples. Furthermore, our approximate computing model main- tains the same level in terms of classification accuracy, does not require retraining, and reduces resource utilization and energy con- sumption of the CNN. We conducted extensive experiments on a set of strong adversarial attacks; We empirically show that the proposed implementation increases the robustness of a LeNet-5 and an Alexnet CNNs by up to 99% and 87%, respectively for strong transferability-based attacks along with up to 50% saving in energy consumption due to the simpler nature of the approximate logic. We also show that a white box attack requires a remarkably higher noise budget to fool the approximate classifier, causing an average of 4 dB degradation of the PSNR of the input image relative to the images that succeed in fooling the exact classifier.","[Guesmi, Amira; Baklouti, Mouna; Frikha, Tarek; Abid, Mohamed] Univ Sfax, ENIS, Sfax, Tunisia; [Alouani, Ihsen] Polytech Univ, IEMN, Hauts De France, France; [Khasawneh, Khaled N.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Abu-Ghazaleh, Nael] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",,"Guesmi, A (corresponding author), Univ Sfax, ENIS, Sfax, Tunisia.",amira.guesmi@stud.enis.tn; lhsen.Alouani@uphf.fr; kkhasawn@gmu.edu,,"Alouani, Ihsen/0000-0001-5102-8087; FRIKHA, Tarek/0000-0001-8402-8059; Guesmi, Amira/0000-0002-8992-7958","NSF [CNS-1646641, CNS1619322, CNS-1955650]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We would like to thank the reviewers and shepherd for the feedback and suggestions that have substantially improved the paper.

The computation of DCNNs is memory intensive due to large feature maps and neuron connections, and the performance highly depends on the capability of hardware resources. With the recent trend of wearable devices and Internet of Things, it becomes desirable to integrate the DCNNs onto embedded and portable devices that require low power and energy consumptions and small hardware footprints. Recently stochastic computing (SC)-DCNN demonstrated that SC as a low-cost substitute to binary-based computing radically simplifies the hardware implementation of arithmetic units and has the potential to satisfy the stringent power requirements in embedded devices. In SC, many arithmetic operations that are resource-consuming in binary designs can be implemented with very simple hardware logic, alleviating the extensive computational complexity. It offers a colossal design space for integration and optimization due to its reduced area and soft error resiliency. In this paper, we present HEIF, a highly efficient SC-based inference framework of the large-scale DCNNs, with broad applications including (but not limited to) LeNet-5 and AlexNet, that achieves high energy efficiency and low area/ hardware cost. Compared to SC-DCNN, HEIF features: 1) the first (to the best of our knowledge) SC-based rectified linear unit activation function to catch up with the recent advances in software models and mitigate degradation in application-level accuracy; 2) the redesigned approximate parallel counter and optimized stochastic multiplication using transmission gates and inverse mirror adders; and 3) the new optimization of weight storage using clustering. Most importantly, to achieve maximum energy efficiency while maintaining acceptable accuracy, HEIF considers holistic optimizations on cascade connection of function blocks in DCNN, pipelining technique, and bit-stream length reduction. Experimental results show that in large-scale applications HEIF outperforms previous SC-DCNN by the throughput of 4.1x, by area efficiency of up to 6.5x, and achieves up to 5.6x energy improvement.","[Li, Zhe; Ren, Ao; Cai, Ruizhe; Ding, Caiwen; Tang, Jian; Qiu, Qinru] Syracuse Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Li, Ji; Qian, Xuehai; Draper, Jeffrey] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Yuan, Bo] CUNY City Coll, Dept Elect Engn, New York, NY 10031 USA; [Wang, Yanzhi] Northeastern Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Li, Z (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",zli89@syr.edu; jli724@usc.edu; aren@syr.edu; rcai100@syr.edu; cading@syr.edu; xuehai.qian@usc.edu; draper@isi.edu; byuan@ccny.cuny.edu; jtang02@syr.edu; qiqiu@syr.edu; yanz.wang@northeastern.edu,"Cai, Ruizhe/AAE-1774-2022","Ding, Caiwen/0000-0003-0891-1231; Li, Zhe/0000-0001-7056-4133","seedling fund of DARPA SAGA Program [FA8750-17-2-0021]; Natural Science Foundation of China [61133004, 61502019]; Natural Science Foundation [CNS-1739748, CNS-1704662];  [CSD2007-00050]",seedling fund of DARPA SAGA Program; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ,"This work was supported by the seedling fund of DARPA SAGA Program under Grant FA8750-17-2-0021, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61133004 and Grant 61502019, in part by the Natural Science Foundation under Grant CNS-1739748 and Grant CNS-1704662, and in part by the Consolider under Grant CSD2007-00050.",,61,27,27,2,7,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0278-0070,1937-4151,,IEEE T COMPUT AID D,IEEE Trans.

These errors can affect the stored values of convolutional neural network (CNN) weights and activations, compromising their accuracy. In this article, we introduce Embedded Ensemble CNNs (E(2)CNNs), our architectural design methodology to conceive ensembles of convolutional neural networks to improve robustness against memory errors compared to a single-instance network. Ensembles of CNNs have been previously proposed to increase accuracy at the cost of replicating similar or different architectures. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art (SoA) ensembles do not suit well embedded systems, in which memory and processing constraints limit the number of deployable models. Our proposed architecture solves that limitation applying SoA compression methods to produce an ensemble with the same memory requirements of the original architecture, but with improved error robustness. Then, as part of our new E(2)CNNs design methodology, we propose a heuristic method to automate the design of the voter-based ensemble architecture that maximizes accuracy for the expected memory error rate while bounding the design effort. To evaluate the robustness of E(2)CNNs for different error types and densities, and their ability to achieve energy savings, we propose three error models that simulate the behavior of SRAM and eDRAM operating at sub-nominal conditions. Our results show that E(2)CNNs achieves energy savings of up to 80 percent for LeNet-5, 90 percent for AlexNet, 60 percent for GoogLeNet, 60 percent for MobileNet and 60 percent for an optimized industrial CNN, while minimizing the impact on accuracy. Furthermore, the memory size can be decreased up to 54 percent by reducing the number of members in the ensemble, with a more limited impact on the original accuracy than obtained through pruning alone.","[Ponzina, Flavio; Peon-Quiros, Miguel; Atienza, David] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Embedded Syst Lab ESL, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Burg, Andreas] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Telecommun Circuits Lab TCL, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",,"Ponzina, F (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Embedded Syst Lab ESL, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",flavio.ponzina@epfl.ch; miguel.peon@epfl.ch; andreas.burg@epfl.ch; david.atienza@epfl.ch,"Atienza Alonso, David/F-3964-2011","Atienza Alonso, David/0000-0001-9536-4947; Peon-Quiros, Miguel/0000-0002-5760-090X; Ponzina, Flavio/0000-0002-9662-498X",Swiss NSF ML-Edge Project [200020_182009]; ERC Consolidator Grant COMPUSAPIEN [725657]; EC H2020 WiPLASH [863337],Swiss NSF ML-Edge Project; ERC Consolidator Grant COMPUSAPIEN; EC H2020 WiPLASH,"This work was supported in part by the Swiss NSF ML-Edge Project under Grant 200020_182009, in part by the ERC Consolidator Grant COMPUSAPIEN under Grant 725657, and in part by the EC H2020 WiPLASH under Grant 863337, Project.",,34,1,1,0,1,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",0018-9340,1557-9956,,IEEE T COMPUT,IEEE Trans.

They usually need large computing resources and time and process easy and hard samples inefficiently in the same way. Another undesirable problem is that the network generally needs to be retrained to learn new incoming data. Efforts have been made to reduce the computing resources and realize incremental learning by adjusting architectures, such as scalable effort classifiers, multi-grained cascade forest (gcForest), conditional deep learning (CDL), tree CNN, decision tree structure with knowledge transfer (ERDK), forest of decision trees with radial basis function (RBF) networks, and knowledge transfer (FDRK). In this article, a parallel multistage wide neural network (PMWNN) is presented. It is composed of multiple stages to classify different parts of data. First, a wide radial basis function (WRBF) network is designed to learn features efficiently in the wide direction. It can work on both vector and image instances and can be trained in one epoch using subsampling and least squares (LS). Second, successive stages of WRBF networks are combined to make up the PMWNN. Each stage focuses on the misclassified samples of the previous stage. It can stop growing at an early stage, and a stage can be added incrementally when new training data are acquired. Finally, the stages of the PMWNN can be tested in parallel, thus speeding up the testing process. To sum up, the proposed PMWNN network has the advantages of: 1) optimized computing resources; 2) incremental learning; and 3) parallel testing with stages. The experimental results with the MNIST data, a number of large hyperspectral remote sensing data, and different types of data in different application areas, including many image and nonimage datasets, show that the WRBF and PMWNN can work well on both image and nonimage data and have very competitive accuracy compared to learning models, such as stacked autoencoders, deep belief nets, support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), LeNet-5, RBF network, recently proposed CDL, broad learning, gcForest, ERDK, and FDRK.","[Xi, Jiangbo; Zhao, Chaoying] Changan Univ, Sch Geol Engn & Geomat, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Ersoy, Okan K.] Purdue Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Fang, Jianwu] Changan Univ, Sch Elect & Control Engn, Xian 710064, Peoples R China; [Wu, Tianjun] Changan Univ, Dept Math & Informat Sci, Coll Sci, Xian 710064, Peoples R China; [Wei, Xin] Xian Inst Opt & Precis Mech, Xian 710072, Peoples R China",,"Xi, JB (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Sch Geol Engn & Geomat, Xian 710054, Peoples R China.;Ersoy, OK (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",xijiangbo@chd.edu.cn; ersoy@purdue.edu,,"Xi, Jiangbo/0000-0003-2258-0993","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1504805]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61806022, 61603057, 41601437, 41874005]; China Scholarship Council (CSC) [201404910404]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),"This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018YFC1504805; in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61806022, Grant 61603057, Grant 41601437, and Grant 41874005; and in part by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) under Scholarship under Grant 201404910404.",,54,1,1,6,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2162-237X,2162-2388,,IEEE T NEUR NET LEAR,IEEE Trans.

During industrial processes, while converting a sheet metal to an end product, new defects are observed and thus need to be identified carefully. Recent studies have shown scratches, bumps, and pollution/dust are identified, but orange peel defects present overall a new challenge. So our model identifies scratches, bumps, and dust by using computer vision algorithms, whereas orange peel defect detection with deep learning have a better performance. The goal of this paper was to resolve artificial intelligence (AI) as an AI landing challenge faced in identifying various kinds of sheet metal-based product defects by ALDB-DL process automation. Therefore, our system model consists of multiple cameras from two different angles to capture the defects of the sheet metal-based drawer box. The aim of this paper was to solve multiple defects detection as design and implementation of Industrial process integration with AI by Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) for sheet metal-based drawer box defect detection, stated as AI Landing for sheet metal-based Drawer Box defect detection using Deep Learning (ALDB-DL). Therefore, the scope was given as achieving higher accuracy using multi-camera-based image feature extraction using computer vision and deep learning algorithm for defect classification in AOI. We used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values for pre-processing, LeNet with a (1 x 1) convolution filter, and a Global Average Pooling (GAP) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm to achieve the best results. It has applications for sheet metal-based product industries with improvised quality control for edge and surface detection. The results were competitive as the precision, recall, and area under the curve were 1.00, 0.99, and 0.98, respectively. Successively, the discussion section presents a detailed insight view about the industrial functioning with ALDB-DL experience sharing.","[Sheu, Ruey-Kai; Chen, Lun-Chi; Pai, Kai-Chih; Chen, Chia-Yu] Tunghai Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Taichung 407224, Taiwan; [Pardeshi, Mayuresh Sunil] Tunghai Univ, AI Ctr, Taichung 407224, Taiwan",,"Chen, LC (corresponding author), Tunghai Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Taichung 407224, Taiwan.;Pardeshi, MS (corresponding author), Tunghai Univ, AI Ctr, Taichung 407224, Taiwan.",rickysheu@thu.edu.tw; lunchi@thu.edu.tw; mayuresh@thu.edu.tw; kcpai@thu.edu.tw; g08350007@thu.edu.tw,"PAI, KAI-CHIH/AAE-1576-2019; Sheu, Ruey-Kai/AAT-5106-2021","PAI, KAI-CHIH/0000-0002-4379-1186; Chen, Lun-Chi/0000-0002-8449-7872; Sheu, Ruey-Kai/0000-0002-3014-8095","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan [MOST 109-2622-E-029-013]; DDS-THU AI center; Ming-Chuan Industrial Co.

First, the clinical data of COPD patients treated in hospital from September 2018 to December 2020 were collected, and CT and X-ray images were also collected. CT-CNN and X ray-CNN single modal models were constructed based on the LeNet-5 model. The randomized fusion algorithm was introduced to construct a fused CNN model for the diagnosis of COPD patients, and the recognition effect of the model was verified. Subsequently, the three-dimensional reconstruction of the patient's bronchus was performed using the classified CT images, and the changes of CT quantitative parameters in COPD patients were compared and analyzed. Finally, COPD patients were treated with salmeterol/fluticasone (COPD-C) and combined with clarithromycin (COPD-T). In addition, the differences between patients' lung function indexes, blood gas indexes, St. George respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) scores, and the number of acute exacerbations (AECOPD) before and after treatment were evaluated. The results showed that the randomized fusion model under different iteration times and batch sizes always had the highest recognition rate, sensitivity, and specificity compared to the two single modal CNN models, but it also had longer training time. After CT images were used to quantitatively evaluate the changes of the patient's bronchus, it was found that the area of the upper and lower lung lobes of the affected side of COPD patients and the ratio of the area of the tube wall to the bronchus were significantly changed. The lung function, blood gas index, and SGRQ score of COPD-T patients were significantly improved compared with the COPD-C group (P < 0.05), but there was no considerable difference in AECOPD (P > 0.05). In summary, the randomized fusion-based CNN model can improve the recognition rate of COPD, and salmeterol/fluticasone combined with clarithromycin therapy can significantly improve the clinical treatment effect of COPD patients.","[Luo, Guoping; Lin, Anqi; Yang, Zhaoqiang; Chen, Yujian; Mo, Cuiying] Guangzhou Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Resp, Shunde Hosp, Foshan 528300, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Mo, Cuiying] Wuzhongpei Mem Hosp, Psychosomat Med, Foshan 528300, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,"Mo, CY (corresponding author), Guangzhou Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Resp, Shunde Hosp, Foshan 528300, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Mo, CY (corresponding author), Wuzhongpei Mem Hosp, Psychosomat Med, Foshan 528300, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",201823252501009@zcmu.edu.cn,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,3,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",2040-2295,2040-2309,,J HEALTHC ENG,J.

Then, a DWI-MRI image discrimination model was established based on the class-structured deep convolutional neural network (CSDCNN) algorithm. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), and edge preserve index (EPI) were applied to evaluate the image quality after processing by the CSDCNN algorithm; the accuracy, recall rate, precise rate, and F-1 score were employed to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of CSDCNN algorithm; the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was adopted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on the CSDCNN algorithm, and SegNet, LeNet, and AlexNet algorithms were introduced for comparison. The results showed that the PSNR, MSE, and EPI values of DWI-MRI images of patients with osteosarcoma were 29.1941, 0.0016, and 0.9688, respectively, after using the CSDCNN algorithm to process the DWI-MRI images. The three indicators were significantly better than other algorithms, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). According to the results of imaging diagnosis of patients with osteosarcoma, there was no significant difference between the assisted diagnosis effect of the CSDCNN algorithm and the pathological examination results (P > 0.05). The results of adjuvant chemotherapy based on the CSDCNN algorithm found that the ADC(mean) value of the patients after chemotherapy was 1.66 +/- 0.17 and the ADC(min) value was 1.33 +/- 0.15; the two indicators were significantly higher than other algorithms, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the CSDCNN algorithm had a good effect on DWI-MRI image processing of patients with osteosarcoma, which could improve the diagnostic accuracy of patients with osteosarcoma. Moreover, the diagnosis results based on this algorithm could achieve better neoadjuvant chemotherapy effects and assist clinicians in imaging diagnosis and clinical treatment of patients with osteosarcoma.","[Hu, Yong; Tang, Jie; Zhao, Shenghao; Li, Ye] Wuhan Fourth Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Wuhan 430000, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Li, Y (corresponding author), Wuhan Fourth Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Wuhan 430000, Hubei, Peoples R China.",huyongodsp@126.com; tangjiewufh@163.com; zhaoshenghaonsy@yeah.net; rm001225@whu.edu.cn,,,,,,,25,0,0,1,1,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1058-9244,1875-919X,,SCI PROGRAMMING-NETH,Sci.

Along with the rapid development of digital imaging technology and artificial intelligence, now determination of plant pigments can be done in a non-destructive and real-time manner. In previous research, a prototype of the non-destructive and real-time system has been developed by utilizing the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to produce predictions of three main photosynthetic pigments, i.e., chlorophyll, carotenoid, and anthocyanin. The CNN model was chosen due to its ability to handle raw digital image data without prior feature extraction. In the near future, this ability will be useful for developing analytical portable devices. Input of the system is multispectral plant digital image, and the output are predicted pigment concentration. Convolutional Neural Network performance depends on several factors, among them are data quality, algorithm tuning (weight initialization, learning rate, activation function, network topology, batches and epochs, optimization and loss) and models combination. The focus of this research is to improve the accuracy of CNN model by optimizing the selection for updating CNN architecture parameters which are optimization method and the loss function. As it is already known, there is no single optimizer can outperform for all cases. The selection for the optimizer should be made by considering the variability of the data and the nonlinearity level of the relationship patterns that exist in the data. Because the theoretical calculation is not enough to determine the best optimizer, an experiment is needed to see at firsthand the performance of optimizers that allegedly matches the characteristics of the data being analyzed. Gradient descent optimization method is well known for its ease of computing and speed of convergence on large datasets. Here, 7 gradient descent-based optimizers were compared, i.e., Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Gradient (Adagrad), Adaptive Delta (Adadelta), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), Adaptive Momentum (Adam), Adaptive Max Pooling (Adamax), and Nesterov Adaptive Momentum (Nadam). From the eksperiment result it is known that Adam is the best optimizer to improve LeNet ability in handling a digital image-pigments content relationship. However, when the resources for experimentation is limited, using Adadelta and Adamax is a wise choice to minimize risk.","[Prilianti, K.

The target is to simultaneously reduce the model storage size and accelerate the computation, with minor effect on accuracy. Two important categories of DNN model compression techniques are weight pruning and weight quantization. The former leverages the redundancy in the number of weights, whereas the latter leverages the redundancy in bit representation of weights. These two sources of redundancy can be combined, thereby leading to a higher degree of DNN model compression. However, a systematic framework of joint weight pruning and quantization of DNNs is lacking, thereby limiting the available model compression ratio. Moreover, the computation reduction, energy efficiency improvement, and hardware performance overhead need to be accounted besides simply model size reduction. To address these limitations, we present ADMM-NN, the first algorithm-hardware co-optimization framework of DNNs using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), a powerful technique to solve non-convex optimization problems with possibly combinatorial constraints. The first part of ADMM-NN is a systematic, joint framework of DNN weight pruning and quantization using ADMM. It can be understood as a smart regularization technique with regularization target dynamically updated in each ADMM iteration, thereby resulting in higher performance in model compression than the state-of-the-art. The second part is hardware-aware DNN optimizations to facilitate hardware-level implementations. We perform ADMM-based weight pruning and quantization considering (i) the computation reduction and energy efficiency improvement, and (ii) the hardware performance overhead due to irregular sparsity. The first requirement prioritizes the convolutional layer compression over fully-connected layers, while the latter requires a concept of the break-even pruning ratio, defined as the minimum pruning ratio of a specific layer that results in no hardware performance degradation. Without accuracy loss, ADMM-NN achieves 85x and 24x pruning on LeNet-5 and AlexNet models, respectively, - significantly higher than the state-of-the-art. Combining weight pruning and quantization, we achieve 1,910x and 231x reductions in overall model size on these two benchmarks. Highly promising results are also observed on other representative DNNs such as VGGNet and ResNet-50.

Recent works on compact DCNNs as well as pruning methods are effective, yet with drawbacks. For instance, more than half the size of all MobileNet models lies in their last two layers, mainly because compact separable convolution (CONV) layers are not applicable to their last fully connected (FC) layers. Also, in pruning methods, the compression is gained at the expense of irregularity in the DCNN architecture, which necessitates additional indexing memory to address nonzero weights, thereby increasing memory footprint, decompression delays, and energy consumption. In this article, we propose cyclic sparsely connected (CSC) architectures, with memory/computation complexity of O( N log N), where N is the number of nodes/channels given a DCNN layer that, contrary to compact depthwise separable layers, can be used as an overlay for both FC and CONV layers of O(N-2). Also, contrary to pruning methods, CSC architectures are structurally sparse and require no indexing due to their cyclic nature. We show that both standard convolution and depthwise convolution layers are special cases of the CSC layers, whose mathematical function, along with FC layers, can be unified into one single formulation and whose hardware implementation can be carried out under one arithmetic logic component. We examine the efficacy of the CSC architectures for compression of LeNet, AlexNet, and MobileNet DCNNs with precision ranging from 2 to 32 bits. More specifically, we surge upon the compact 8-bit quantized 0.5 MobileNet V1 and show that by compressing its last two layers with CSC architectures, the model is compressed by similar to 1.5x with a size of only 873 kB and little accuracy loss. Finally, we design a configurable hardware that implements all types of DCNN layers including FC, CONV, depthwise, CSCFC, and CSC-CONV indistinguishably within a unified pipeline. We implement the hardware on a tiny Xilinx field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for total on-chip processing of the compressed MobileNet that, compared to the related work, has the highest Inference/J while utilizing the smallest FPGA.","[Hosseini, Morteza; Manjunath, Nitheesh Kumar; Prakash, Bharat; Mazumder, Arnab; Chandrareddy, Vandana; Mohsenin, Tinoosh] Univ Maryland, Dept Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Homayoun, Houman] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Hosseini, M (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.",hs10@umbc.edu,,"Mazumder, Arnab/0000-0002-9550-7917; Manjunath, Nitheesh/0000-0003-1745-9072",,,,,46,2,2,0,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1063-8210,1557-9999,,IEEE T VLSI SYST,IEEE Trans.

Although printed character recognition has achieved remarkable success in recent years, bank card recognition is not limited to traditional printed character recognition. There are two types of bank cards: unembossed bank cards, such as most debit cards which usually use printed characters, and embossed bank cards, such as most credit cards which mainly use raised characters. Recognition of raised characters is very challenging due to its own characteristics, and there is a lack of fast and good methods to handle it. To better recognize raised characters, we propose an effective method based on deep learning to detect and recognize bank cards in complex natural scenes. The method can accurately recognize the card number characters on embossed and unembossed bank cards. First, to break the limitation that YOLOv3 algorithm is usually used for object detection, we propose a novel approach that enables YOLOv3 to be used not only for bank card detection and classification, but also for character recognition. The CANNYLINES algorithm is used for rectification and the Scharr operator is introduced to locate the card number region. The proposed method can satisfy bank card detection, classification and character recognition in complex natural scenes, such as complex backgrounds, distorted card surfaces, uneven illumination, and characters with the same or similar color to the background. To further improve the recognition accuracy, a printed character recognition model based on ResNet-32 is proposed for the unembossed bank cards. According to the color and morphological characteristics of embossed bank cards, raised character recognition model combining traditional morphological methods and LeNet-5 convolutional neural network is proposed for the embossed bank cards. The experimental results on the collected bank card dataset and bank card number dataset show that our proposed method can effectively detect and identify different types of bank cards. The accuracy of the detection and classification of bank cards reaches 100%. The accuracy of the raised characters recognition on the embossed bank card is 99.31%, and the accuracy of the printed characters recognition on the unembossed bank card reaches 100%.","[Lin, Hanyang; Zhan, Yongzhao] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Commun Engn, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lin, Hanyang] Jiangsu Start Dima Data Proc Co Ltd, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shiqin; Ke, Xiao; Chen, Yuzhong] Fuzhou Univ, Coll Math & Comp Sci, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China",,"Lin, HY (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Commun Engn, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Lin, HY (corresponding author), Jiangsu Start Dima Data Proc Co Ltd, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",linyanhanson@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [61,972,097]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2020 J01494]; Industry-Academy Cooperation Project of Fujian Province [2018H6010]; University Production Project of Fujian Province [2017H6008]; Fujian Collaborative Innovation Center for Big Data Application in Governments; Fujian Engineering Research Center of Big Data Analysis and Processing",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Industry-Academy Cooperation Project of Fujian Province; University Production Project of Fujian Province; Fujian Collaborative Innovation Center for Big Data Application in Governments; Fujian Engineering Research Center of Big Data Analysis and Processing,"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61,972,097, in part by the NaturalScienceFoundationofFujian Province under Grant 2020 J01494, in part by the Industry-Academy Cooperation Project of Fujian Province under Grant 2018H6010, in part by the University Production Project of Fujian Province under Grant 2017H6008, in part by the Fujian Collaborative Innovation Center for Big Data Application in Governments, and in part by the Fujian Engineering Research Center of Big Data Analysis and Processing.

At present, the training of artificial intelligence models mostly are based on GPU platforms. Although GPUs offer high computing performance, their power consumption and cost are relatively high. It is not suitable to use GPUs as the implementation platform in certain application scenarios with demanding power consumption and cost. The emergence of high-performance heterogeneous architecture devices provides a new path for the integration of artificial intelligence training and inference. Typically, in Xilinx and Intel's multi-core heterogeneous architecture, multiple high-performance processors and FPGAs are integrated into a single chip. When compared with the current separate training and inference method, heterogeneous architectures leverage a single chip to realize the integration of AI training and inference, providing a good balance of training and inference of different targets, further reducing the cost of training and implementation of AI inference and power consumption, so as to achieve the lightweight goals of computation, and to improve the flexibility and robustness of the system. In this paper, based on the LeNet-5 network structure, we first introduced the process of network training using a multi-core CPU in Xilinx's latest multi-core heterogeneous architecture device, MPSoC. Then, the method of converting the network model into hardware logic implementation was studied, and the model parameters were transferred from the processing system of the device to the hardware accelerator structure, composed of programmable logic through the bus interface AXI provided on the chip. Finally, the integrated implementation method was tested and verified in Xilinx MPSoC. According to the test results, the recognition accuracy of this lightweight deployment scheme on MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10 dataset reached 99.5 and 75.4% respectively, while the average processing time of the single frame was only 2.2 ms. In addition, the power consumption of the network within the SoC hardware accelerator is only 1.363 W at 100 MHz.","[Zheng, Yangyang; He, Bin; Li, Tianling] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",,"He, B (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",2020200780@mail.buct.edu.cn; hebin@mail.buct.edu.cn; 2021200821@mail.buct.edu.cn,"li, tianling/GNM-9924-2022",,,,,,42,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Between April 2017 and July 2018, four aerial surveys of Big Island were undertaken to map changes to island vegetation following helicopter herbicide sprays to eradicate weeds, including the creeper Coastal Morning Glory (Ipomoea cairica) and Kikuyu Grass (Cenchrus clandestinus). The spraying was followed by a large scale planting campaign to introduce native plants, such as tussocks of Spiny-headed Mat-rush (Lomandra longifolia). Three approaches to mapping vegetation were evaluated, including: (i) a pixel-based image classification algorithm applied to the composite spectral wavebands of the images collected, (ii) manual digitisation of vegetation directly from images based on visual interpretation, and (iii) the application of a machine learning algorithm, LeNet, based on a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting planted Lomandra tussocks. The uncertainty of each approach was assessed via comparison against an independently collected field dataset. Each of the vegetation mapping approaches had a comparable accuracy; for a selected weed management and planting area, the overall accuracies were 82 %, 91 % and 85 % respectively for the pixel based image classification, the visual interpretation / digitisation and the CNN machine learning algorithm. At the scale of the whole island, statistically significant differences in the performance of the three approaches to mapping Lomandra plants were detected via ANOVA. The manual digitisation took a longer time to perform than others. The three approaches resulted in markedly different vegetation maps characterised by different digital data formats, which offered fundamentally different types of information on vegetation character. We draw attention to the need to consider how different digital map products will be used for vegetation management (e.g. monitoring the health individual species or a broader profile of the community). Where individual plants are to be monitored over time, a feature-based approach that represents plants as vector points is appropriate. The CNN approach emerged as a promising technique in this regard as it leveraged spatial information from the UAV images within the architecture of the learning framework by enforcing a local connectivity pattern between neurons of adjacent layers to incorporate the spatial relationships between features that comprised the shape of the Lomandra tussocks detected.","[Hamylton, S.

To achieve high performance and energy efficiency, hardware acceleration (especially inference) of DNNs is intensively studied both in academia and industry. However, we still face two challenges: large DNN models and datasets, which incur frequent off-chip memory accesses; and the training of DNNs, which is not well-explored in recent accelerator designs. To truly provide high throughput and energy efficient acceleration for the training of deep and large models, we inevitably need to use multiple accelerators to explore the coarse-grain parallelism, compared to the fine-grain parallelism inside a layer considered in most of the existing architectures. It poses the key research question to seek the best organization of computation and dataflow among accelerators. In this paper, we propose a solution HYPAR to determine layer-wise parallelism for deep neural network training with an array of DNN accelerators. HYPAR partitions the feature map tensors (input and output), the kernel tensors, the gradient tensors, and the error tensors for the DNN accelerators. A partition constitutes the choice of parallelism for weighted layers. The optimization target is to search a partition that minimizes the total communication during training a complete DNN. To solve this problem, we propose a communication model to explain the source and amount of communications. Then, we use a hierarchical layer-wise dynamic programming method to search for the partition for each layer. HYPAR is practical: the time complexity for the partition search in HYPAR is linear. We apply this method in an HMC-based DNN training architecture to minimize data movement. We evaluate HYPAR with ten DNN models from classic Lenet to large-size model VGGs, and the number of weighted layers of these models range from four to nineteen. Our evaluation finds that: the default Model Parallelism is indeed the worst; the default Data Parallelism is not the best; but hybrid parallelism can be better than either the default Data Parallelism or Model Parallelism in DNN training with an array of accelerators. Our evaluation shows that HYPAR achieves a performance gain of 3.39x and an energy efficiency gain of 1.51x compared to Data Parallelism on average, and HYPAR performs up to 2.40x better than one weird trick.","[Song, Linghao; Mao, Jiachen; Li, Hai; Chen, Yiran] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Zhuo, Youwei; Qian, Xuehai] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",,"Song, LH (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",linghao.song@duke.edu; jiachen.mao@duke.edu; youweizh@usc.edu; xuehai.qian@usc.edu; hai.li@duke.edu; yiran.chen@duke.edu,"Li, Hai/L-8558-2017; Chen, Yiran/L-4812-2017","Li, Hai/0000-0003-3228-6544; Song, Linghao/0000-0002-7450-2842; Chen, Yiran/0000-0002-1486-8412","NSF [1725456, 1615475]; DOE [DE-SC0018064]; National Science Foundation [NSF-CCF-1657333, NSF-CCF-1717754, NSF-CNS-1717984, NSF-CCF-1750656]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the anonymous reviewers of HPCA 2019, MICRO 2018, ISCA 2018 for their constructive and insightful comments.

Recently developed topical gamma scintillation sensors provide a way to monitor Time Activity Curves (TACs) and determine the presence of activity remaining at the injection site after injecting dose. However, TAC analysis and visual inspection by physician of static PET images differ in many cases which has been a recent research concern. In this work, a deep learning (DL) based classification was implemented to study whether this approach can be a viable solution to classify the injection data based on their quality. Method: A supervised machine learning technique was adopted and TACs obtained from the sensors were fed as input to a neural network. The network was trained to classify two classes of data i.e. good quality and poor quality injections. The performance of the network was tested on the basis of 3-fold cross-validation. Result: The network could label the good quality (92.39% data) and poor quality (7.61% data) injection data with around approximate to 98% and approximate to 86% accuracy respectively with an overall accuracy of approximate to 97%.

OBJECTIVE To create a deep-learning network that could directly estimate function from structure de novo to provide an en face high-resolution map of estimated retinal sensitivity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional imaging study using data collected between January 1, 2016, and November 30, 2017, from the Natural History Observation and Registry of macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) evaluated 38 participants with confirmed MacTel from 2 centers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean absolute error of estimated compared with observed retinal sensitivity. Observed retinal sensitivity was obtained with fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry). Estimates of retinal sensitivity were made with deep-learning models that learned on superpositions of high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and microperimetry results. Those predictions were used to create high-density en face sensitivity maps of the macula. Training, validation, and test sets were segregated at the patient level. RESULTS A total of 2499 microperimetry sensitivities were mapped onto 1708 OCT B-scans from 63 eyes of 38 patients (mean [SD] age, 74.3 [9.7] years; 15 men [39.5%]). The numbers of examples for our algorithm were 67 899 (103 053 after data augmentation) for training, 1695 for validation, and 1212 for testing. Mean absolute error results were 4.51 dB (95% CI, 4.36-4.65 dB) when using linear regression and 3.66 dB (95% CI, 3.53-3.78 dB) when using the LeNet model. Using a 49.9 million-variable deep-learning model, a mean absolute error of 3.36 dB (95% CI, 3.25-3.48 dB) of retinal sensitivity for validation and test was achieved. Correlation showed a high degree of agreement (Pearson correlation r = 0.78). By paired Wilcoxon rank sum test, our model significantly outperformed these 2 baseline models (P <.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE High-resolution en face maps of estimated retinal sensitivities were created in eyes with MacTel. The maps were of unequalled resolution compared with microperimetry and were able to correctly delineate functionally healthy and impaired retina. This model may be useful to monitor structural and functional disease progression and has potential as an objective surrogate outcome measure in investigational trials.","[Kihara, Yuka; Lee, Cecilia S.; Wu, Yue; Xiao, Sa; Lee, Aaron Y.] Univ Washington, Dept Ophthalmol, 325 Ninth Ave,POB 359608, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Heeren, Tjebo F.

Research trends show that the state-of-the-art networks are getting deeper and deeper and such networks have shown significant performance increase. Deeper and larger neural networks imply the increase in computational intensity and memory footprint. This is particularly a problem for inference-based applications on resource constrained computing platforms. On the other hand, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are becoming a promising choice in giving hardware solutions for most deep learning implementations due to their high-performance and low-power features. With the rapid formation of various state-of-the-art CNN architectures, a flexible CNN hardware processor that can handle different CNN architectures and yet customize itself to achieve higher resource efficiency and optimum performance is critically important. In this paper, a novel and highly flexible DCNN processor, MulNet, is proposed. MulNet can be used to process most regular state-of-the-art CNN variants aiming at maximizing resource utilization of a target device. A processing core with multiplier and without multiplier is employed to achieve that. We formulated optimum fixed-point quantization format for MulNet by analyzing layer-by-layer quantization error. We also created a power-of-2 quantization for multiplier-free (MF) processing core of MulNet. Both quantizations significantly reduced the memory space needed and the logic consumption in the target device. We utilized Xilinx Zynq SoCs to leverage the one die hybrid (CPU and FPGA) architecture. We devised a scheme that utilizes Zynq processing system (PS) for memory intensive layers and the Zynq programmable logic (PL) for computationally intensive layers. We implemented modified LeNet, CIFAR-10 full, ConvNet processor (CNP), MPCNN, and AlexNet to evaluate MulNet. Our architecture with MF processing cores shows the promising result, by saving 36%-72% on-chip memory and 10%-44% DSP48 IPs, compared to the architecture with cores implemented using the multiplier. Comparison with the state of the art showed a very promising 25-40x DSP48 and 25-29x on-chip memory reduction with up to 136.9-GOP/s performance and 88.49-GOP/s/W power efficiency. Hence, our results demonstrate that the proposed architecture can be very expedient for resource constrained devices.","[Hailesellasie, Muluken Tadesse; Hasan, Syed Rafay] Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA",,"Hailesellasie, MT (corresponding author), Tennessee Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Cookeville, TN 38505 USA.",mthailese142@students.tntech.edu,,,,,,,33,9,9,0,9,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019.0,7,,,,,,47509,47524,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907865,0.0,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,HV8AB,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000466201900001,0

It motivates the intensive research on model compression with two main approaches. Weight pruning leverages the redundancy in the number of weights and can be performed in a non-structured, which has higher flexibility and pruning rate but incurs index accesses due to irregular weights, or structured manner, which preserves the full matrix structure with a lower pruning rate. Weight quantization leverages the redundancy in the number of bits in weights. Compared to pruning, quantization is much more hardware-friendly and has become a ``must-do'' step for FPGA and ASIC implementations. Thus, any evaluation of the effectiveness of pruning should be on top of quantization. The key open question is, with quantization, what kind of pruning (non-structured versus structured) is most beneficial? This question is fundamental because the answer will determine the design aspects that we should really focus on to avoid the diminishing return of certain optimizations. This article provides a definitive answer to the question for the first time. First, we build ADMM-NN-S by extending and enhancing ADMM-NN, a recently proposed joint weight pruning and quantization framework, with the algorithmic supports for structured pruning, dynamic ADMM regulation, and masked mapping and retraining. Second, we develop a methodology for fair and fundamental comparison of non-structured and structured pruning in terms of both storage and computation efficiency. Our results show that ADMM-NN-S consistently outperforms the prior art: 1) it achieves 348x, 36x, and 8x overall weight pruning on LeNet-5, AlexNet, and ResNet-50, respectively, with (almost) zero accuracy loss and 2) we demonstrate the first fully binarized (for all layers) DNNs can be lossless in accuracy in many cases. These results provide a strong baseline and credibility of our study. Based on the proposed comparison framework, with the same accuracy and quantization, the results show that non-structured pruning is not competitive in terms of both storage and computation efficiency. Thus, we conclude that structured pruning has a greater potential compared to non-structured pruning. We encourage the community to focus on studying the DNN inference acceleration with structured sparsity.","[Ma, Xiaolong; Lin, Sheng; Yuan, Geng; Li, Zhengang; Lin, Xue; Wang, Yanzhi] Northeastern Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Ye, Shaokai] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne, Ctr Neuroprosthet, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Zhang, Linfeng; Tan, Sia Huat; Ma, Kaisheng] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Interdisciplinary Informat Sci IIIS, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [He, Zhezhi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Fan, Deliang] Arizona State Univ, Dept Elect Comp & Energy Engn, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Qian, Xuehai] Univ Southern Calif, Ming Hsieh Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",,"Ma, XL (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",ma.xiaol@northeastern.edu,"he, zhe/GSJ-2307-2022","Ma, Xiaolong/0000-0003-3753-7648","National Science Foundation [CCF-1919117, CCF-1937500, CCF-1901378]; Army Research Office (ARO) Young Investigator Program [76598CSYIP]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Army Research Office (ARO) Young Investigator Program,"This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Award CCF-1919117, Award CCF-1937500, and Award CCF-1901378 and in part by the Army Research Office (ARO) Young Investigator Program under Grant 76598CSYIP.

The training processes of deep neural network (DNN) models are time-consuming, and require massive training data and large hardware overhead. These issues have led to the outsourced training procedure, pre-trained models supplied from third parties, or massive training data from untrusted users. However, a few recent researches indicate that, by injecting some well-designed backdoor instances into the training set, the attackers can create a concealed backdoor in the DNN model. In this way, the attacked model still works normally on the benign inputs, but when a backdoor instance is submitted, some specific abnormal behaviors will be triggered. Existing studies all focus on attacking a single target that triggered by a single backdoor (referred to as One-to-One attack), while the backdoor attacks against multiple target classes, and backdoor attacks triggered by multiple backdoors have not been studied yet. In this article, for the first time, we propose two advanced backdoor attacks, the multi-target backdoor attacks and multi-trigger backdoor attacks: 1) One-to-N attack, where the attacker can trigger multiple backdoor targets by controlling the different intensities of the same backdoor; 2) N-to-One attack, where such attack is triggered only when all the N backdoors are satisfied. Compared with existing One-to-One attacks, the proposed two backdoor attacks are more flexible, more powerful and more difficult to be detected. Besides, the proposed backdoor attacks can be applied under the weak attack model, where the attacker has no knowledge about the parameters and architectures of the DNN models. Experimental results show that these two attacks can achieve better or similar performances when injecting a much smaller proportion or same proportion of backdoor instances than those existing One-to-One backdoor attacks. The two attack methods can achieve high attack success rates (up to 100 percent in MNIST dataset and 92.22 percent in CIFAR-10 dataset), while the test accuracy of the DNN model has hardly dropped (as low as 0 percent in LeNet-5 model and 0.76 percent in VGG-16 model), thus will not raise administrator's suspicions. Further, the two attacks are also evaluated on a large and realistic dataset (Youtube Aligned Face dataset), where the maximum attack success rate reaches 90 percent (One-to-N) and 94 percent (N-to-One), and the accuracy degradation of target face recognition model (VGGFace model) is only 0.05 percent. The proposed One-to-N and N-to-One attacks are demonstrated to be effective and stealthy against two state-of-the-art defense methods.","[Xue, Mingfu; He, Can; Wang, Jian] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China; [Liu, Weiqiang] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China",,"Xue, MF (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210016, Peoples R China.",mingfu.xue@nuaa.edu.cn; hecan@nuaa.edu.cn; wangjian@nuaa.edu.cn; liuweiqiang@nuaa.edu.cn,,"Xue, Mingfu/0000-0003-2408-503X; Liu, Weiqiang/0000-0001-8398-8648","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61602241, 62022041]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61602241 and 62022041.,,31,8,8,4,4,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1545-5971,1941-0018,,IEEE T DEPEND SECURE,IEEE Trans.

At the same time, researchers have tried to evaluate the explainability performance of various XAIs. However, most previous evaluation methods are human-centric, that is, subjective, where they rely on how much the results of explanation are similar to what people's decision is based on rather than what features actually affect the decision in the model. Their XAI selections are also dependent of datasets. Furthermore, they are focusing only on the output variation of a target class. On the other hand, this paper proposes a robust heatmap assisted accuracy score (HAAS) scheme over datasets that helps selecting machine-centric explanation algorithms to show what actually leads to the decision of a given classification network. The proposed method modifies the input image with the heatmap scores obtained by a given explanation algorithm and then puts the resultant heatmap assisted (HA) images into the network to estimate the accuracy change. The resultant metric (HAAS) is computed as a ratio of accuracies of the given network over HA and original images. The proposed evaluation scheme is verified in the image classification models of LeNet-5 for MNIST and VGG-16 for CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ILSVRC2012 over totally 11 XAI algorithms of saliency map, deconvolution, and 9 layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) configurations. Consequently, for LRP1 and LRP3, MINST showed largest HAAS values of 1.0088 and 1.0079, CIFAR-10 achieved 1.1160 and 1.1254, STL-10 had 1.0906 and 1.0918, and ILSVRC2012 got 1.3207 and 1.3469. While LRP1 consists of E-rules for input, convolutional, and fully-connected layers, LRP3 adopts a bounded-rule for an input layer and the same E-rules for other layers as LRP1. The consistency of evaluation results of HAAS and AOPC has been compared by means of Kullback-Leibler divergence, ensuring that HAAS is the more robust evaluation method than AOPC independently of datasets since HAAS has much lower average divergence of 0.0251 than AOPC of 0.3048. In addition, the validity of the proposed HAAS scheme is further investigated through the inverted HA test that employs inverted HA images made up with inverted heatmap scores and estimates the accuracy degradation caused by applying them to the network. The XAI algorithms with largest HAAS results experience biggest accuracy degradation in the inverted HA test.","[Lee, Junhee; Cho, Hyeonseong; Pyun, Yun Jang; Nam, Hyoungsik] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Informat Display, Seoul 02447, South Korea; [Kang, Suk-Ju] Sogang Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Seoul 04107, South Korea",,"Nam, H (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Informat Display, Seoul 02447, South Korea.",hyoungsiknam@khu.ac.kr,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) through the Ministry of Science, Information Communication Technology (ICT) and Future Planning [NRF-2019R1F1A1061114]; Brain Korea 21 Four Program in 2022","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) through the Ministry of Science, Information Communication Technology (ICT) and Future Planning(National Research Foundation of Korea); Brain Korea 21 Four Program in 2022","This work was supported in part by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) through the Ministry of Science, Information Communication Technology (ICT) and Future Planning under Grant NRF-2019R1F1A1061114, and in part by the Brain Korea 21 Four Program in 2022.",,62,0,0,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2022.0,10,,,,,,64832,64849,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3184453,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,2J2QJ,,gold,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000815508000001,0

Diffractive deep neural networks have been introduced earlier as an optical machine learning framework that uses task-specific diffractive surfaces designed by deep learning to all-optically perform inference, achieving promising performance for object classification and imaging. We demonstrate systematic improvements in diffractive optical neural networks, based on a differential measurement technique that mitigates the strict nonnegativity constraint of light intensity. In this differential detection scheme, each class is assigned to a separate pair of detectors, behind a diffractive optical network, and the class inference is made by maximizing the normalized signal difference between the photodetector pairs. Using this differential detection scheme, involving 10 photodetector pairs behind 5 diffractive layers with a total of 0.2 million neurons, we numerically achieved blind testing accuracies of 98.54%, 90.54%, and 48.51% for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and grayscale CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Moreover, by utilizing the inherent parallelization capability of optical systems, we reduced the cross-talk and optical signal coupling between the positive and negative detectors of each class by dividing the optical path into two jointly trained diffractive neural networks that work in parallel. We further made use of this parallelization approach and divided individual classes in a target dataset among multiple jointly trained diffractive neural networks. Using this class-specific differential detection in jointly optimized diffractive neural networks that operate in parallel, our simulations achieved blind testing accuracies of 98.52%, 91.48%, and 50.82% for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and grayscale CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, coming close to the performance of some of the earlier generations of all-electronic deep neural networks, e.g., LeNet, which achieves classification accuracies of 98.77%, 90.27%, and 55.21% corresponding to the same datasets, respectively. In addition to these jointly optimized diffractive neural networks, we also independently optimized multiple diffractive networks and utilized them in a way that is similar to ensemble methods practiced in machine learning; using 3 independently optimized differential diffractive neural networks that optically project their light onto a common output/detector plane, we numerically achieved blind testing accuracies of 98.59%, 91.06%, and 51.44% for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and grayscale CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Through these systematic advances in designing diffractive neural networks, the reported classification accuracies set the state of the art for all-optical neural network design. The presented framework might be useful to bring optical neural network-based low power solutions for various machine learning applications and help us design new computational cameras that are task-specific.","[Li, Jingxi; Mengu, Deniz; Luo, Yi; Rivenson, Yair; Ozcan, Aydogan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Li, Jingxi; Mengu, Deniz; Luo, Yi; Rivenson, Yair; Ozcan, Aydogan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Bioengn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Li, Jingxi; Mengu, Deniz; Luo, Yi; Rivenson, Yair; Ozcan, Aydogan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Calif NanoSyst Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",,"Ozcan, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Ozcan, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Bioengn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Ozcan, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Calif NanoSyst Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",ozcan@ucla.edu,"Ozcan, Aydogan/I-2608-2013; Li, Jingxi/AAO-8583-2021; Mengu, Deniz/ABA-3931-2020","Ozcan, Aydogan/0000-0002-0717-683X; Li, Jingxi/0000-0001-6595-8680; ",Koc Group,Koc Group,Ozcan Research Lab acknowledges the funding of the Koc Group.,,37,100,103,18,56,SPIE-SOC PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98225 USA",,2577-5421,,ADV PHOTONICS,Adv.

Such networks have compact models in which weights are constrained to only 1 bit and can be packed several in one memory entry that minimizes memory footprint to its finest. Packing weights also facilitates executing single instruction, multiple data with simple circuitry that allows maximizing performance and efficiency. The proposed BiNMAC has light-weight cores that support domain-specific instructions, and a router-based memory access architecture that helps with efficient implementation of layers in binary precision weight/activation neural networks of proper size. With only 3.73% and 1.98% area and average power overhead, respectively, novel instructions such as Combined Population-Count-XNOR, Patch-Select, and Bit-based Accumulation are added to the instruction set architecture of the BiNMAC, each of which replaces execution cycles of frequently used functions with 1 clock cycle that otherwise would have taken 54, 4, and 3 clock cycles, respectively. Additionally, customized logic is added to every core to transpose 16x16-bit blocks of memory on a bit-level basis, that expedites reshaping intermediate data to be well-aligned for bitwise operations. A 64-cluster architecture of the BiNMAC is fully placed and routed in 65-nm TSMC CMOS technology, where a single cluster occupies an area of 0.53 mm(2) with an average power of 232 mW at 1-GHz clock frequency and 1.1 V. The 64-cluster architecture takes 36.5 mm(2) area and, if fully exploited, consumes a total power of 16.4 W and can perform 1,360 Giga Operations Per Second (GOPS) while providing full programmability. To demonstrate its scalability, four binarized case studies including ResNet-20 and LeNet-5 for high-performance image classification, as well as a ConvNet and a multilayer perceptron for low-power physiological applications were implemented on BiNMAC. The implementation results indicate that the population-count instruction alone can expedite the performance by approximately 5x. When other new instructions are added to a RISC machine with existing population-count instruction, the performance is increased by 58% on average. To compare the performance of the BiNMAC with other commercial-off-the-shelf platforms, the case studies with their double-precision floating-point models are also implemented on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 SoC (CPU+GPU). The results indicate that, within a margin of similar to 2.1%-9.5% accuracy loss, BiNMAC on average outperforms the TX2 GPU by approximately 1.9x (or 7.5x with fabrication technology scaled) in energy consumption for image classification applications. On low power settings and within a margin of similar to 3.7%-5.5% accuracy loss compared to ARM Cortex-A57 CPU implementation, BiNMAC is roughly similar to 9.7x-17.2x (or 38.8x-68.8x with fabrication technology scaled) more energy efficient for physiological applications while meeting the application deadline.","[Hosseini, Morteza; Mohsenin, Tinoosh] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, 1000 Hilltop Cir, Catonsville, MD 21250 USA",,"Hosseini, M (corresponding author), Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, 1000 Hilltop Cir, Catonsville, MD 21250 USA.",hs10@umbc.edu; tinoosh@umbc.edu,,,National Science Foundation CAREER Award [1652703],National Science Foundation CAREER Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation CAREER Award under Grant No. 1652703.,,52,1,1,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1550-4832,1550-4840,,ACM J EMERG TECH COM,ACM J.

J,"Hassantabar, S; Wang, ZY; Jha, NK",,,,"Hassantabar, Shayan; Wang, Zeyu; Jha, Niraj K.",,,SCANN: Synthesis of Compact and Accurate Neural Networks,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Architecture synthesis; compact network; compression; dimensionality reduction (DR); energy efficiency; neural network,EFFICIENT,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the driving force behind recent artificial intelligence (AI) research. With the help of a vast amount of training data, neural networks can perform better than traditional machine learning algorithms in many applications. An important problem with implementing a neural network is the design of its architecture. Typically, such an architecture is obtained manually by exploring its hyperparameter space and kept fixed during training. This approach is both time consuming and inefficient. Another issue is that modern neural networks often contain millions of parameters, whereas many applications require small inference models due to imposed resource constraints, such as energy constraints on battery-operated devices. However, efforts to migrate DNNs to such devices typically entail a significant loss of classification accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a two-step neural network synthesis methodology, called DR+SCANN, that combines two complementary approaches to design compact and accurate DNNs. At the core of our framework is the SCANN methodology that uses three basic architecture-changing operations, namely, connection growth, neuron growth, and connection pruning, to synthesize feedforward architectures with arbitrary structure. These neural networks are not limited to the multilayer perceptron structure. SCANN encapsulates three synthesis methodologies that apply a repeated grow-and-prune paradigm to three architectural starting points. DR+SCANN combines the SCANN methodology with dataset dimensionality reduction to alleviate the curse of dimensionality. We demonstrate the efficacy of SCANN and DR+SCANN on various image and nonimage datasets. We evaluate SCANN on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet benchmarks. Without any loss in accuracy, SCANN generates a 46.3 x smaller network than the LeNet-5 Caffe model. We also compare SCANN-synthesized networks with a state-of-the-art fully connected (FC) feedforward model for MNIST, and show 20x (19.9x) reduction in the number of parameters (floating-point operations) with little drop in accuracy. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, we target AlexNet and VGG-16 baseline architectures. SCANN reduces the number of parameters in AlexNet by 10.1x without any drop in accuracy. It reduces the number of parameters in the FC layers of VGG-16 to only 2.5k while increasing accuracy by 1.05%. On the ImageNet dataset, for the VGG-16 and MobileNetV2 architectures, we reduce network parameters by 8.0x and 1.3 x , respectively, with a similar or improved performance over their respective baselines. We also evaluate the efficacy of using dimensionality reduction alongside SCANN (DR+SCANN) on nine small-to-medium-size datasets. Using this methodology enables us to reduce the number of connections in the network by up to 5078.7 x (geometric mean: 82.1x ), with little to no drop in accuracy. On seven out of nine datasets, we show 0.41 %-10.09 % accuracy improvements over the FC baseline models. We also show that our synthesis methodology yields neural networks that are much better at navigating the accuracy versus energy efficiency space. This can enable neural network-based inference even on Internet-of-Things sensors.","[Hassantabar, Shayan; Wang, Zeyu; Jha, Niraj K.] Princeton Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Hassantabar, S (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",seyedh@princeton.edu; zeyuwang@princeton.edu; jha@princeton.edu,,"Hassantabar, Shayan/0000-0003-4297-2097","IP Group; NSF [CNS-1617640, CNS-1907381]",IP Group; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported in part by IP Group and in part by NSF under Grant CNS-1617640 and Grant CNS-1907381.

When considering the residential sector, there can be millions of such loads, each with a very small contribution but can be collectively coordinated. Mean field game (MFG) theory has emerged as a natural tool for mathematically capturing this framework. While most existing works on MFG analysis start from agent cost functions to identify the properties of potential Nash equilibria and the associated agent control laws, this work differs in that an inverse process is followed. We reverse engineer the agent cost functions so that, while remaining comfort sensitive, they are guaranteed to lead via decentralized control laws to a precalculated Nash equilibrium. The latter is desirable from an aggregator's point of view. The approach is illustrated in the case of a power reduction objective for a collection of thermal loads. Furthermore, to effectively manage the impacts of load control actions in a power distribution network, it is shown how the control efforts can be adjusted on a nodal basis using voltage sensitivities.","[Lenet, Quentin; Malhame, Roland P.] Polytech Montreal, Dept Elect Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Nazir, Md Salman] Quanta Technol, Raleigh, NC USA",,"Lenet, Q (corresponding author), Polytech Montreal, Dept Elect Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",quentin.lenet@polymtl.ca; snazir@quanta-technology.com; roland.malhame@polymtl.ca,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0743-1546,,978-1-6654-3659-5,IEEE DECIS CONTR P,,,2021.0,,,,,,,4929,4935,,10.1109/CDC45484.2021.9683273,0.0,,,7,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering,BS9KO,,,,,2022-10-10,WOS:000781990304054,0

Both grains show weak emission bands at approximately 475 nm and approximately 580 nm. The corresponding emission decay times are 54 +/- 1 psec (AgBr) and 46 +/- 1 psec [Ag(I)Br]. Transient absorption shows very broad spectral features centered at about 425-475 nm and 625 nm across the accessible spectral window of 425 nm to 675 nm; these features rise via excellent exponential growth kinetics to a plateau at approximately 3 nsec in the 0 to 12 nsec time window available. The nature of these features has been attributed to plasmon resonance absorption of at least two silver deposits, each with a unique narrow cluster size distribution. The rise times are: for AgBr grains, 0.62 +/- 0.09 nsec (475 nm) and 0.88 +/- 0.09 nsec (625 nm) for excitation energy of approximately 1 mJ/pulse, and 0.91 +/- 0.01 nsec (475 nm) and 1.22 +/- 0.10 nsec (625 nm) for a pump energy of 2:5 mJ/pulse. The corresponding rise times for the Ag(I)Br-gelatino system are: 1.32 +/- 0.08 nsec (475 nm) and 1.45 +/- 0.08 nsec (625 nm) at approximately 1 mJ/pulse, and 0.63 +/- 0.03 nsec (475 nm) and 1.11 +/- 0.02 nsec (625 nm) at 2.5 mJ/pulse energy. The Ag(I)Br system at pump energies of approximately 2.5 mJ/pulse shows transient rise to about 5 nsec, which subsequently decays exponentially at times greater-than-or-equal-to 5 nsec; tau475 nm almost-equal-to 26 +/- 7 nsec and tau625 nm almost-equal-to 9.7 +/- 1.4 nsec. The observed photochemistry of formation of the silver(0) deposits for the AgBr and Ag(I)Br emulsion grains is completely reversible at times greater-than-or-equal-to 10 nsec. The initial stages of this regression were observed for Ag(I)Br; an upper limit of approximately 10 nsec is inferred for the photoholes to reach the grain surface and re-oxidize the Ag(n)o deposits via rehalidization.","THREE M CO CTR,GRAPH RES LAB,ST PAUL,MN 55144",,"SERPONE, N (corresponding author), CONCORDIA UNIV,DEPT CHEM & BIOCHEM,PURE & APPL STUDIES CATALYSIS ENVIRONM & MAT LAB,MONTREAL H3G 1M8,QUEBEC,CANADA.",,,,,,,,54,11,11,0,1,I S & T - SOC IMAGING SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY,SPRINGFIELD,"7003 KILWORTH LANE, SPRINGFIELD, VA 22151",8750-9237,,,J IMAGING SCI TECHN,J.

In this study we characterized the arteritis induced by UK-61,260, an investigational inotropic agent with vasodilatory properties which displays an inhibitory action on cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, in comparison with lesions induced by FM. The compounds were administered to Sprague-Dawley rats by intravenous infusion over 24 h (FM and UK-61,260), orally or subcutaneously (UK-61,260); the rats were killed and necropsied for pathological examination at various times between 0 h and 28 days post-infusion. Infusion of UK-61,260 at doses of 100, 300 or 400 mg/kg produced arteritis mainly in the mesenteric arteries and occasionally in the renal, pancreatic, gastric and coronary arteries. There were no arterial lesions after infusion of 30 mg/kg, or after administration of 30, 100 or 200 mg/kg per day subcutaneously for 7 days, or after acute administration of 100, 300, 400 or 600 mg/kg orally. Infusion of rats with 72 or 144 mg/kg FM produced arteritis over a wider range of tissues than did UK-61,260. However, the arterial lesions produced by infusion of either drag have the same initial aspect and a similar evolution with time. Immediately after the end of the infusion, minimal necrosis and haemorrhage occurred in the media only, without involvement of the endothelium or the perivascular space. This indicates that the media of the artery is the primary site of injury. The lesions seen 1 and 3 days post-infusion were characterized by severe medial necrosis and haemorrhage with perivascular acute inflammation and appeared macroscopically as haemorrhagic spots on the vessels. On days 7, 14 and 28 post-infusion, no medial necrosis or haemorrhage were present, while perivascular chronic inflammation and moderate smooth muscle hyperplasia were seen. It appeared, therefore, that the lesions underwent repair in 28 days, but footprints of the damage were still present 28 days post-infusion. The similarity between arteritis induced in rats by fenoldopam or by UK-61,260, at doses inducing PDE III inhibition, is consistent with the view that they have a similar pathogenesis. In our view it is probable that these pharmacologically and chemically distinct drugs trigger an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP which in turn triggers vascular damage. The arterial changes observed in the current study after acute administration may explain the increased incidence of polyarteritis nodosa occurring in long term toxicity studies with FM or PDE III inhibitors.",,,"HANTON, G (corresponding author), LAB PFIZER,CTR RECH,BP 159,F-37401 AMBOISE,FRANCE.",,,,,,,,23,16,16,0,0,SPRINGER VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010",0340-5761,,,ARCH TOXICOL,Arch.

Characteristics of the working situations were compared for the two places, in respect of goals, resources and constraints of the task, as well as general conditions of the work context. The managers' general missions appeared to be the same, while the managers' responsibility within the organizational systems teas also similar concerning the production process itself. However, the factory manager in Zaire had to face a more constrained situation, with higher unreliability of resources. Similarities concerning the production process, the managers' missions and the organization systems were expected to produce well-known features of the factory managers' work: importance of verbal communication, intensity of relations with subordinates, existence of interactions outside the hierarchical line, fragmentation of activity. Constraints and unreliability were expected to induce a more direct implication of the manager, in terms of nature of speakers involved in communication, number and nature of the objects of intervention, and activity was expected to be more fragmented Data gathered through an analysis of the effective work (Langa, 1994) confirmed the general invariants found in previous studies on managers' work: activity fragmentation, importance of verbal communications - mainly involving direct subordinates -, reactivity to events. On the other hand, they showed the expected differences: the manager in Zaire had more direct verbal communication with people at the executive level or external to the enterprise, while the manager in France had more relationships with his own direct subordinates. In Zaire, the factory manager dealt with more specific ''objects'', throughout the process up to the level of execution. Differences in the managers' activity can be interpreted as determined by the properties of the specific situations. The factory manager in Zaire was more involved in directly commanding and controlling a situation characterized by higher uncertainty and more frequent dysfunction. Cultural and individual differences are discussed. In Zaire, culture both induces constraints (whose effects would probably be different in another economical context), and offers resources for solving problems created by the local conditions. Neither the empirical data nor the previously reported anthropological data enable us to interpret the relationships observed between the characteristics of the managerial situations and the properties of the managers' activity in terms of social-cultural causes. Individual differences might be postulated The factory manager in Zaire might have a personal ''style of command'' particularly well adapted to the features of the situation, whatever their causes. Some lines of research are proposed for resolving these issues.","CNAM,LENET,LAB ERGON,F-75005 PARIS,FRANCE",,"Rogalski, J (corresponding author), UNIV PARIS 08,CNRS,2 RUE LIBERTE,F-93526 ST DENIS 2,FRANCE.",,,,,,,,38,5,5,0,0,UNIV FRANCE,PARIS,"SERVICE DES PERIODIQUES 12 RUE JEAN DE BEAUVAIS, 75005 PARIS, FRANCE",0041-1868,,,TRAV HUMAIN,Trav.

Methods Between January and March 2015, 177 psychiatry residency training directors were sent a survey asking about psychotherapy training practices in their programs, as well as perceived barriers to psychotherapy teaching. Results Eighty-two training directors (44%) completed the survey. While 95% indicated that psychotherapy was a formal learning objective for outpatient clinic rotations, fifty percent or fewer noted psychotherapy was a learning objective in other settings. Most program directors would like to see psychotherapy training included (particularly supportive psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy) on inpatient (82%) and consultation-liaison settings (57%). The most common barriers identified to teaching psychotherapy in these settings were time and perceived inadequate staff training and interest. Conclusions Non-outpatient rotations appear to be an underutilized setting for psychotherapy teaching.","[Blumenshine, Philip] UCONN Hlth, Farmington, CT 06030 USA; [Lenet, Alison E.; Havel, Lauren K.; Arbuckle, Melissa R.; Cabaniss, Deborah L.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, New York, NY USA",,"Blumenshine, P (corresponding author), UCONN Hlth, Farmington, CT 06030 USA.",blumenshine@uchc.edu,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1042-9670,1545-7230,,ACAD PSYCHIATR,Acad.

The authors argue that it is important to understand the specificities of the interplay of these different factors to continue the advancement of our understanding and practice as advocates for health and housing security. Design/methodology/approach An exploratory, qualitative, methodological approach was adopted, using a broad definition of housing insecurity: from absolute homelessness (e.g. residing rough) to invisible homelessness (e.g. couch surfing) to those at risk of homelessness. In total, 26 newcomer (foreign-born women who came to live in Canada during the previous ten years, regardless of their immigration status) women were recruited in Montreal, Canada. Participants were recruited directly through advertisements in public places and in collaboration with community organizations (women's centers, homeless shelters, crisis centers, domestic violence shelters, immigrant settlement agencies and ethnic associations) and they self-identified as having experienced housing insecurity. Efforts were made to include a diversity of immigrant statuses as well as diversity in ethnicity, race, country of origin, family composition, sexual orientation, age and range of physical and mental ability. Women were engaged in semi-structured, open-ended interviews lasting approximately 1 h. Interviews were conducted in English or French in a location and time of participants' choosing. Findings The findings are presented around three themes: how health problems instigate and maintain migrant women's housing insecurity and homelessness; ways in which women's immigration trajectories and legal status may influence their health experiences; and particular coping strategies that migrant women employ in efforts to maintain or manage their health. The authors conclude with implications of these findings for both policy and practice in relation to migrant women who experience or are at risk of housing insecurity and homelessness. Originality/value Intersections of women experiencing migration and housing insecurity in Canadian contexts have rarely been examined. This paper addresses a gap in the literature in terms of topic and context, but also in terms of sharing the voices of migrant women with direct experience with housing insecurity.","[Hanley, Jill; Ives, Nicole; Lenet, Jaime] McGill Univ, Sch Social Work, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hordyk, Shawn-Renee] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Social Work, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Walsh, Christine; Este, David] Univ Calgary, Fac Social Work, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Ben Soltane, Sonia] Univ Ottawa, Sch Social Work, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Hanley, J (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Sch Social Work, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",jill.hanley@mcgill.ca; nicole.ives@mcgill.ca; jaime.lenet@mail.mcgill.ca; Shawn-Renee.hordyk@mail.mcgill.ca; cwalsh@ucalgary.ca; sbensolt@uottawa.ca; deste@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,90,4,4,1,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1747-9894,2042-8650,,INT J MIGR HEALTH SO,Int.

Therefore development of a vehicle for delivery of CHX as an intracanal medication is desirable. This in vitro study assessed the efficacy of two CHX delivery vehicles, a controlled-release device and a gel, to affect antimicrobial substantivity of bovine root dentin. Sixty bovine incisor root specimens were prepared with standardized length (10 mm) and canal diameter (3.3 mm), and coated externally with nail polish. Specimens were divided into four equal groups and their canals medicated for 7 days with either: (i) an experimental controlled-release device containing 25% CHX that was immersed in sterile saline; iii) 2% CHX gel; or(iii) Ca(OH)(2) paste. Sterile saline was used as the positive control. After medication, the canals of the specimens were inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis for 21 days. Root canal dentin samples ranging in depth from 0.1 to 0.45 mm were then obtained using sterile round bars of ascending diameter. Each dentin sample was placed in a separate test tube containing Brain Heart Infusion broth and incubated for 24 h. The optical density (OD) of the broth was then measured spectrophotometrically at 540 nm. The positive control showed significantly higher mean OD values (one-way ANOVA and Tukey's Studentized Range Test; p < 0.001) than the three test groups. The CHX controlled-release device group showed significantly lower OD values than the Ca(OH)(2) group; however only at dentin depths up to 0.2 mm. In contrast, the CHX gel group consistently showed significantly lower OD values than both the CHX controlled-release device and Ca(OH)(2) groups. These results suggest that bovine root canals medicated with 2% CHX get for 7 days acquire antimicrobial properties for at least 21 days.","Univ Toronto, Fac Dent, Dept Endodont, Toronto, ON M5G 1G6, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Pharm, Toronto, ON M5G 1G6, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Community Dent, Toronto, ON M5G 1G6, Canada",,"Friedman, S (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Fac Dent, Dept Endodont, 124 Edward St, Toronto, ON M5G 1G6, Canada.",,"Lawrence, Herenia P/U-6600-2018","Lawrence, Herenia/0000-0002-2340-2307",,,,,20,36,48,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0099-2399,1878-3554,,J ENDODONT,J.

Methods: We investigated the prevalence and causes of RV dysfunction in 27 heart transplant recipients, as measured by lateral tricuspid annular plane excursion (TAPSE) and fractional area change (FAC) at a mean of 15 +/- 11 days after transplant. Tissue Doppler imaging was used to assess systolic time velocity integral (TVI) of the RV basal free wall. A subset of 22 patients had follow-up TAPSE measurement at 406 +/- 121 days. Results: RV systolic dysfunction, defined as TAPSE > 2 standard deviation (SD) below values in a control group, was present in 100% (27/27) of patients (P < 0.05). FAC was also significantly lower in patients compared with controls (P < 0.0001). TVI confirmed the presence of RV dysfunction in all 16 patients with both TAPSE and TVI (P < 0.05). Ischemic time (P = 0.017) and posttransplant tricuspid regurgitation (P = 0.024) were independent predictors of early RV dysfunction (r = 0.753). On follow-up, RV function improved in 15 of 22 patients but all patients remained with TAPSE > 2 SD below controls. Conclusion: This study showed that 100% of patients had reduced RV function early after transplant. Two thirds of patients had partial recovery of RV function during the first year. In all patients, however, RV function remained significantly lower than in controls.

Clinicians must balance risk of both hemorrhage and thrombosis. The optimal timing of pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (VTEp) initiation in this population is unclear. The objective was to evaluate early (< 48 h) compared to late initiation of VTEp in adult trauma patients with blunt abdominal solid organ injury managed nonoperatively. Methods Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to March 2021. Studies comparing timeframes of VTEp initiation were considered. The primary outcome was failure of nonoperative management (NOM) after VTEp initiation. Secondary outcomes included risk of transfusion, other bleeding complications, risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, and mortality. Results Ten cohort studies met inclusion criteria, with a total of 4642 patients. Meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in the risk of failure of NOM among patients receiving early VTEp (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.01-3.05, p = 0.05). There was no significant difference in risk of transfusion. Odds of DVT were significantly lower in the early group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.22-0.59, p < 0.0001). There was no difference in mortality (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.82-2.75, p = 0.19). All studies were at serious risk of bias due to confounding. Conclusions Initiation of VTEp earlier than 48 h following hospitalization is associated with an increased risk of failure of NOM but a decreased risk of DVT. Absolute failure rates of NOM are low. Initiation of VTEp at 48 h may balance the risks of bleeding and VTE.","[Lamb, Tyler; Lenet, Tori; Glen, Peter] Ottawa Hosp, Dept Surg, Div Gen Surg, 725 Parkdale Ave, Ottawa, ON K1Y 1J8, Canada; [Lamb, Tyler; Lenet, Tori; Zahrai, Amin; Shaw, Joseph R.; McLarty, Ryan] Univ Ottawa, Fac Med, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Shaw, Joseph R.; Le Gal, Gregoire] Ottawa Hosp, Dept Med, Div Hematol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Shaw, Joseph R.; Le Gal, Gregoire; Glen, Peter] Ottawa Hosp, Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [McLarty, Ryan] Ottawa Hosp, Dept Surg, Div Urol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Shorr, Risa] Ottawa Hosp, Lib & Informat Sci, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Glen, Peter] Ottawa Hosp, Ottawa Reg Trauma Program, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Lamb, T (corresponding author), Ottawa Hosp, Dept Surg, Div Gen Surg, 725 Parkdale Ave, Ottawa, ON K1Y 1J8, Canada.",tlamb@toh.ca,,,Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI),Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI),Study Sponsor: Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI).,,27,1,1,1,1,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1749-7922,,,WORLD J EMERG SURG,World J.

Histologically, the lesions consisted of well-demarcated cup-shaped foci of epidermal endophytic hyperplasia with marked parakeratosis. In the upper stratum spinosum and in the stratum granulosum, solitary or small collections of enlarged keratinocytes were observed with basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies and a single eosinophilic fibrillar cytoplasmic inclusion, Ultrastructurally, viruslike particles (40-45 nm in diameter) were observed within the nucleus, free or aggregated in crystalline arrays.

Drug-induced hepatotoxicity constitutes a large percentage of these reactions. A thorough understanding of the genetic events, specifically, the early decision-making processes underlying biological changes caused by drugs and metabolites, is required. To assist in the understanding of these events, we have employed the model hepatotoxin, paracetamol (APAP), and GeneChip technology to investigate global genetic events seen after nontoxic and toxic doses in the mouse. Mice were dosed [vehicle, nontoxic APAP (1 mmol/ kg), and toxic APAP (3.5 mmol/kg)], and individual hepatic RNA samples were hybridized to separate chips to determine interanimal variation. Statistical analysis detected 175 CD-1 mouse genes that were significantly regulated (P < 4.1 x 10(-6)), and nonsignificant genes were discarded. For clarity, the significantly regulated genes were then binned into categories according to their major function-antioxidant, glutathione, metabolism, transcription, immune, and apoptosis. There was no hepatic stress observed after dosing 1 mmol/kg APAP, when measured by serum alanine aminotransferase levels. Hepatic toxicity was observed at both 4 and 24 h after a 3.5 mmol/kg dose of APAP. Time course expression profiles for selected genes have been created. These results demonstrate that most active gene expression occurs around 4 h after a toxic dose of APAP. Down-regulation of these genes is observed over 24 h, coinciding with the development of overt toxicity. These data provide a deeper understanding of the in vivo time course of physiological responses of the liver to chemical stress and provide a logical step forward for the investigation of new chemical entities demonstrated positive in chemically reactive metabolite screens.

Due to its anatomic location, the caudate lobe is frequently involved in PHC. This review aimed to examine the impact of caudate lobe resection (CLR) in addition to hepatectomy and bile duct resection for patients with PHC. Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were systematically reviewed from inception to October 2021 to identify studies comparing patients undergoing surgical resection with hepatectomy and bile duct resection with or without CLR for treatment of PHC. Outcomes included the proportion of patients achieving R0 resection, overall survival (OS), and perioperative morbidity. Results Altogether, 949 studies were screened. The review included eight observational studies reporting on 1137 patients. The patients who underwent CLR had a higher likelihood of R0 resection (odds ratio [OR], 5.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.64-12.95) and a better OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54-0.79) than those who did not. The use of CLR did not increase the risk of perioperative morbidity (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.65-1.63). Conclusions Given the higher likelihood of R0 resection, improved OS, and no apparent increase in perioperative morbidity, this review supports routine caudate lobectomy in the surgical management of PHC. These results should be interpreted with caution given the lack of high-quality prospective data and the high probability of selection bias.","[Gilbert, Richard W.

Achieving a margin-negative resection (R0) is challenging given the anatomic location of tumors and remains the most important prognostic indicator of long-term survival. The objective of this study is to review the impact of intraoperative revision of positive biliary margins in PHC on oncologic outcomes. Patients and Methods Electronic databases were searched from inception to October 2021. Studies comparing three types of patients undergoing resection of PHC with intraoperative frozen section of the proximal and/or distal bile ducts were identified: those who were margin-negative (R0), those with an initially positive margin who had revised negative margins (R1R0), and those with a persistently positive margin with or without revision of a positive margin (R1). The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included risk of postoperative complication. Results A total of 449 studies were screened. Ten retrospective observational studies reporting on 1955 patients were included. Patients undergoing successful revision of a positive proximal and/or distal bile duct margin (R1R0) had similar OS to those with a primary margin-negative resection (R0) [hazard ratio (HR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-1.19, p = 0.56, I-2 = 84%], and significantly better OS than patients with a positive final bile duct margin (R1) (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34-0.79, p = 0.002, I-2 = 0%). There was no increase in the risk of postoperative complications associated with additional resection, although postoperative morbidity was inconsistently reported. Conclusions This review supports routine intraoperative biliary margin evaluation during resection of PHC with revision if technically feasible.","[Lenet, Tori; Gilbert, Richard W.

Evidence-based recommendations guiding RBC transfusion in the operative setting are limited.Methods:The search strategy was adapted from a previous Cochrane Review. Electronic databases were searched from January 2016 to February 2021. Included studies from the previous Cochrane Review were considered for eligibility from before 2016. RCTs comparing intraoperative transfusion strategies were considered for inclusion. Co-primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and morbidity. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative and perioperative RBC transfusion. Meta-analysis was carried out using random-effects models.Results:Fourteen trials (8641 patients) were included. One cardiac surgery trial accounted for 56% of patients. There was no difference in 30-day mortality [relative risk (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-1.29] and pooled postoperative morbidity among the studied outcomes when comparing restrictive and liberal protocols. Two trials reported worse composite outcomes with restrictive triggers. Intraoperative (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.43-0.64) and perioperative (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62-0.79) blood transfusions were significantly lower in the restrictive group compared to the liberal group.Conclusions:Intraoperative restrictive transfusion strategies decreased perioperative transfusions without added postoperative morbidity and mortality in 12/14 trials. Two trials reported worse outcomes. Given trial design and generalizability limitations, uncertainty remains regarding the safety of broad application of restrictive transfusion triggers in the operating room. Trials specifically designed to address intraoperative transfusions are urgently needed.","[Lenet, Tori; Baker, Laura; Park, Lily; Vered, Michael; Fergusson, Dean A.; Martel, Guillaume] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp, Dept Surg, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Lenet, Tori; Baker, Laura; McIsaac, Daniel I.; Tinmouth, Alan; Fergusson, Dean A.; Martel, Guillaume] Ottawa Hosp, Clin Epidemiol Program, Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Shorr, Risa; Davis, Alexandra] Ottawa Hosp, Library Serv, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [McIsaac, Daniel I.] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tinmouth, Alan; Fergusson, Dean A.] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp, Dept Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tinmouth, Alan; Fergusson, Dean A.] Canadian Blood Serv, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Martel, G (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp, Dept Surg, Ottawa, ON, Canada.;Martel, G (corresponding author), Ottawa Hosp, Clin Epidemiol Program, Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",gumartel@toh.ca,,,Canadian Blood Services Blood Efficiency and Accelerator Award Program 2017; Academic Health Science Center Alternative Funding Plan Innovation Fund 2017,Canadian Blood Services Blood Efficiency and Accelerator Award Program 2017; Academic Health Science Center Alternative Funding Plan Innovation Fund 2017,Supported by the Canadian Blood Services Blood Efficiency and Accelerator Award Program 2017 and the Academic Health Science Center Alternative Funding Plan Innovation Fund 2017.,,52,1,1,1,2,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0003-4932,1528-1140,,ANN SURG,Ann.

Summary of Background Data: RBC transfusions are common during surgery and there is evidence of wide variability in practice. Methods: Major electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL), guideline clearinghouses and Google Scholar were systematically searched from inception to January 2019 for CPGs pertaining to indications for intraoperative RBC transfusion. Eligible guidelines were retrieved and their quality assessed using AGREE II. Relevant recommendations were abstracted and synthesized to allow for a comparison between guidelines. Results: Ten guidelines published between 1992 and 2018 provided indications for intraoperative transfusions. No guideline addressed intraoperative transfusion decision-making as its primary focus. Six guidelines provided criteria for transfusion based on hemoglobin (range 6.0-10.0 g/dL) or hematocrit (<30%) triggers. In the absence of objective transfusion rules, CPGs recommended considering other parameters such as blood loss (n = 7), signs of end organ ischemia (n = 5), and hemodynamics (n = 4). Evidence supporting intraoperative recommendations was extrapolated primarily from the nonoperative setting. There was wide variability in the quality of included guidelines based on AGREE II scores. Conclusion: This review has identified several clinical practice guidelines providing recommendations for intraoperative transfusion. The existing guidelines were noted to be highly variable in their recommendations and to lack a sufficient evidence base from the intraoperative setting. This represents a major knowledge gap in the literature.","[Baker, Laura; Park, Lily; Gilbert, Richard; Ahn, Hilalion; Martel, Andre; Lenet, Tori; Fergusson, Dean A.; Martel, Guillaume] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp, Dept Surg, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Baker, Laura; Lenet, Tori; McIsaac, Daniel I.; Tinmouth, Alan; Fergusson, Dean A.; Martel, Guillaume] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Clin Epidemiol Program, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Davis, Alexandra] Ottawa Hosp, Learning Serv, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [McIsaac, Daniel I.] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [McIsaac, Daniel I.] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp, Dept Pain Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tinmouth, Alan; Fergusson, Dean A.] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp, Dept Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tinmouth, Alan; Fergusson, Dean A.] Canadian Blood Serv, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Martel, G (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp, Dept Surg, Ottawa, ON, Canada.;Martel, G (corresponding author), Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Clin Epidemiol Program, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",gumartel@toh.ca,,,Canadian Blood Services Blood Efficiency and Accelerator Award Program; Academic Health Science Center Alternative Funding Plan Innovation Fund; Vered Family Chair in HPB Research at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute,Canadian Blood Services Blood Efficiency and Accelerator Award Program; Academic Health Science Center Alternative Funding Plan Innovation Fund; Vered Family Chair in HPB Research at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute,Financial support was provided by the Canadian Blood Services Blood Efficiency and Accelerator Award Program 2017 and The Academic Health Science Center Alternative Funding Plan Innovation Fund 2017.

Feedback learning has been found to vary with dopamine levels; increases in dopamine facilitate learning from positive feedback, whereas decreases facilitate learning from negative feedback. Given previous evidence of striatal dopamine depletion in healthy aging, we investigated behavioral differences between college-aged and healthy older adults using a feedback learning task that is sensitive to both frontal and striatal processes. Method: Seventeen college-aged (M = 18.9 years) and 24 healthy, older adults (M = 70.3 years) completed the Probabilistic Selection task, in which participants are trained on probabilistic stimulus-outcome information and then tested to determine whether they learned more from positive or negative feedback. Results: As a group, the older adults learned equally well from positive and negative feedback, whereas the college-aged group learned more from positive than negative feedback, F( I, 39) = 4.10, p < .05, r(effect) = .3. However, these group differences were not due to older individuals being more balanced learners. Most individuals of both ages were balanced learners, but while all of the remaining young learners had a positive bias, the remaining older learners were split between those with positive and negative learning biases (chi(2)(2) = 6.12, p < .047). Conclusions: These behavioral results are consistent with the dopamine theory of striatal aging, and suggest there might be adult age differences in the kinds of information people use when faced with a current choice.","[Simon, Jessica R.; Howard, Darlene V.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Psychol, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Howard, James H., Jr.] Georgetown Univ, Dept Neurol, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Howard, James H., Jr.] Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Psychol, Washington, DC 20064 USA",,"Simon, JR (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Psychol, 301 N White Gravenor Bldg, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",jrs92@georgetown.edu,,,"National Institute on Aging/National Institutes of Health [R37 AG15450]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING [R37AG015450, R01AG036863] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",National Institute on Aging/National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"This research was supported by Grant R37 AG15450 from the National Institute on Aging/National Institutes of Health.

An infection of pancreatic necrosis (IPN) results in a more than twofold increase in mortality risk as compared with patients with sterile necrosis. We sought to identify prognostic factors for the development of IPN among adult patients with severe or necrotizing pancreatitis. METHODS We conducted this prognostic review in accordance with systematic review methodology guidelines. We searched six databases from inception through March 21, 2021. We included English language studies describing prognostic factors associated with the development of IPN. We pooled unadjusted odds ratio (uOR) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for prognostic factors using a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool and certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS We included 31 observational studies involving 5,210 patients. Factors with moderate or higher certainty of association with increased IPN risk include older age (uOR, 2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-3.45, moderate certainty), gallstone etiology (aOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.36-4.04, high certainty), greater than 50% necrosis of the pancreas (aOR, 3.61; 95% CI, 2.15-6.04, high certainty), delayed enteral nutrition (aOR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.26-3.47, moderate certainty), multiple or persistent organ failure (aOR, 11.71; 95% CI, 4.97-27.56, high certainty), and invasive mechanical ventilation (uOR, 12.24; 95% CI, 2.28-65.67, high certainty). CONCLUSION This meta-analysis confirms the association between several clinical early prognostic factors and the risk of IPN development among patients with severe or necrotizing pancreatitis. These findings provide the foundation for the development of an IPN risk stratification tool to guide more targeted clinical trials for prevention or early intervention strategies.","[Tran, Alexandre; Bertens, Kimberly A.; Balaa, Fady K.; Kubelik, Dalibor; Matar, Maher; Lenet, Tori I.; Martel, Guillaume] Univ Ottawa, Dept Surg, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tran, Alexandre; Lenet, Tori I.; Martel, Guillaume] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tran, Alexandre; Fernando, Shannon M.; Kubelik, Dalibor] Univ Ottawa, Div Crit Care, Dept Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Fernando, Shannon M.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Emergency Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Rochwerg, Bram] McMaster Univ, Dept Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Rochwerg, Bram] McMaster Univ, Dept Hlth Res Methods Evidence & Impact, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Inaba, Kenji] Univ Southern Calif, Div Acute Care Surg, Dept Surg, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Engels, Paul T.] McMaster Univ, Div Gen Surg, Dept Surg, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Engels, Paul T.] McMaster Univ, Div Crit Care, Dept Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada",,"Tran, A (corresponding author), 1053 Carling Ave, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4E9, Canada.",aletran@toh.ca; sfernando@qmed.ca; bram.rochwerg@gmail.com; kenji.inaba@med.usc.edu; kbertens@toh.ca; engelsp@mcmaster.ca; fbalaa@toh.ca; dkubelik@toh.ca; mmatar@toh.ca; tlenet@toh.ca; gumartel@toh.ca,,,Hamilton Health Sciences New Investigator Grant,Hamilton Health Sciences New Investigator Grant,B.R. is supported by a Hamilton Health Sciences New Investigator Grant.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) reverses airway obstruction and may reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Remote monitoring of PAP (as opposed to in-person visits) may improve access to sleep medicine services. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a clinical program that delivers treatment for OSA through PAP remote monitoring using external facilitation as an implementation strategy.MethodsParticipants included patients with OSA at a Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). PAP adherence and clinical disease severity on treatment (measured by the apnea hypopnea index [AHI]) were the preliminary effectiveness outcomes across two delivery models: usual care (in-person) and Telehealth nurse-delivered remote monitoring. We also assessed visit duration and travel distance. A prospective, mixed-methods evaluation examined the two-tiered external facilitation implementation strategy.ResultsThe pilot project included N=52 usual care patients and N=38 Telehealth nurse-delivered remote monitoring patients. PAP adherence and disease severity were similar across the delivery modalities. However, remote monitoring visits were 50% shorter than in-person visits and saved a mean of 72miles of travel (median=45.6, SD=59.0, mode=17.8, range 5.4-220). A total of 62 interviews were conducted during implementation with a purposive sample of 12 clinical staff involved in program implementation. Weekly external facilitation delivered to both front-line staff and supervisory physicians was necessary to ensure patient enrollment and treatment. Synchronized, two-tiered facilitation at the executive and coordinator levels proved crucial to developing the clinical and administrative infrastructure to support a PAP remote monitoring program and to overcome implementation barriers.ConclusionsRemote PAP monitoring had similar efficacy to in-person PAP services in this Veteran population. Although external facilitation is a widely-recognized implementation strategy in quality improvement projects, less is known about how multiple facilitators work together to help implement complex programs. Two-tiered facilitation offers a model well-suited to programs where innovations span disciplines, disrupt professional hierarchies (such as those between service chiefs, clinicians, and technicians) and bring together providers who do not know each other, yet must collaborate to improve access to care.","[Rattray, Nicholas A.; Damush, Teresa M.; Miech, Edward J.; Ferguson, Jared; Myers, Jennifer; Homoya, Barbara J.; Bravata, Dawn M.] Roudebush VAMC, Vet Hlth Indiana, VA Hlth Serv Res & Dev Ctr Hlth Informat & Commun, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Rattray, Nicholas A.; Damush, Teresa M.; Miech, Edward J.; Bravata, Dawn M.] Regenstrief Inst Inc, William M Tierney Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Rattray, Nicholas A.; Damush, Teresa M.; Miech, Edward J.; Ferguson, Jared; Myers, Jennifer; Homoya, Barbara J.; Bravata, Dawn M.] Vet Hlth Indiana, QUERI, VA Precis Monitoring PRIS M, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Rattray, Nicholas A.] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Anthropol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Rattray, Nicholas A.; Khaw, Andrew; McGrath, Mackenzie; Damush, Teresa M.; Miech, Edward J.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Lenet, Adam; Stahl, Stephanie] Vet Hlth Indiana, Internal Med & Sleep Serv, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Stahl, Stephanie] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Guenther, David] Vet Hlth Indiana, Nursing Serv, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Bravata, Dawn M.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Internal Med & Geriatr, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA",,"Rattray, NA (corresponding author), Roudebush VAMC, Vet Hlth Indiana, VA Hlth Serv Res & Dev Ctr Hlth Informat & Commun, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.;Rattray, NA (corresponding author), Regenstrief Inst Inc, William M Tierney Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",nrattray@iupui.edu,,"Rattray, Nicholas/0000-0002-9683-889X","VA HSR&D PRIS-M QUERI Center at the Richard L.

In this study, we investigated the utility of transfer learning (TL) to improve urban flood susceptibility assessment using knowledge outside the training domain. Specifically, we pre-trained a convolutional neural network-based assessment model in one catchment and then tried to improve the model performance of two other catchments by transferring knowledge from the pre-trained model. The results showed that (1) with the help of TL, the model performance of the two transferred catchments improved by 10%-25% in different data-rich and data-sparse scenarios; and (2) TL typically provided positive effects when we transferred knowledge from a well pre-trained model in data-rich catchment. However, it may induce negative effects when the pre-trained model has poor accuracy. This study provides a promising approach to improve ML-based hazard assessment by sharing knowledge from different regions.","[Zhao, Gang; Pang, Bo; Xu, Zongxue; Cui, Lizhuang; Wang, Jingjing; Zuo, Depeng; Peng, Dingzhi] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Key Lab Hydrol Cycle & Sponge City Technol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Gang] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",,"Pang, B (corresponding author), Room 9718,Jingshi Bldg,Xinjiekouwai St 19, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",gang.zhao@bristol.ac.uk; pb@bnu.edu.cn,"Peng, Dingzhi/E-2396-2013; Peng, Dingzhi/ACA-5299-2022; Peng, Dingzhi/GQY-6569-2022; Peng, Dingzhi/AAI-6706-2020","Peng, Dingzhi/0000-0003-2118-5174; Peng, Dingzhi/0000-0003-2118-5174; Peng, Dingzhi/0000-0003-2118-5174; Peng, Dingzhi/0000-0003-2118-5174","National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1865102, 51879008]; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin [SKL2020TS01]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin,"Bo Pang is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51879008).

In response, the authors developed an interactive course for third-year psychiatry residents to reinforce prescribing skills. Methods Residents participate in a facilitated group discussion combined with a role-play exercise where they mock-prescribe medication to their peers. Each session is focused on one medication or class of medications with an emphasis on various aspects of informed consent (such as describing the indication, dosing, expected benefits, potential side effects, and necessary work-up and follow up). In the process of implementing the course at a second site, the original format was modified to include self-assessment measures and video examples of experienced faculty members prescribing to a simulated patient. Results The course was initially developed at one site and has since been disseminated to a number of other institutions. Between 2010 and 2016, 144 residents participated in the course at the authors' two institutions. Based upon pre/post surveys conducted with a subset of residents, the course significantly improved comfort with various aspects of prescribing. Although residents may also gain comfort in prescribing with experience (as the course coincides with the major outpatient clinical training year), improvement in comfort-level was also noted for medications that residents had relatively little experience initiating. At the end of the year, half of the residents indicated the course was one of their top three preferred methods for learning psychopharmacology in addition to direct clinical experience and supervision (with none listing didactics). Conclusion An interactive prescribing workshop can improve resident comfort with prescribing and may be preferred over a traditional, lecture-based approach. The course may be particularly helpful for those medications that are less commonly used. Based upon our experience, this approach can be easily implemented across institutions..","[Kavanagh, Eileen P.; Arbuckle, Melissa R.; Lenet, Alison E.; Winchel, Ronald M.; Nossel, Ilana; DeSilva, Ravi; Park, Henry C.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Cahill, John; Subramanyam, Kalyani; Ross, David A.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT USA; [Caravella, Rachel A.; Ackerman, Marra] NYU, Sch Med, New York, NY USA",,"Kavanagh, EP (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA.",kavanag@nyspi.columbia.edu,"Ross, David A/D-3430-2014","Ross, David A/0000-0001-7426-9561; Caravella, Rachel/0000-0003-1136-5913",,,,,10,4,4,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1042-9670,1545-7230,,ACAD PSYCHIATR,Acad.

It has been shown to be preventable with prophylactic amiodarone, which is only recommended in high-risk individuals due to the potential associated side effects. Risk factors for POAF have been identified and incorporated into a prediction model to identify high-risk patients. Further evaluation in the form of a multicenter clinical trial is required to assess the effectiveness of prophylaxis specifically in this high-risk population. The feasibility of such a trial first needs to be assessed. Methods: The PREP-AF trial is a double-blind randomized controlled feasibility trial. Individuals undergoing major thoracic surgery who are identified to be high-risk by the POAF prediction model will be randomized 1:1 to receive a short course of amiodarone vs. placebo in the immediate postoperative period. The primary outcome is feasibility, which will be measured by the number of eligible patients identified, consented, and randomized; intervention adherence; and measurement of future outcomes of a full trial. Discussion: This study will determine the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic amiodarone, in high-risk patients undergoing major thoracic surgery. This will inform the development of a multi-center trial to establish if prophylactic amiodarone is safe and effective at reducing the incidence of POAF. Preventing this adverse event will not only improve outcomes for patients but also reduce the associated health resource utilization and costs.","[Smith, Heather A.; Lenet, Tori; Sigler, Greg] Univ Ottawa, Dept Surg, Div Gen Surg, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Kanji, Salmaan] Ottawa Hosp, Dept Pharm, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Kanji, Salmaan; Ferguson, Dean] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tran, Diem T.

In the present study, we report on rare variants (one nonsense and six missense variants) in SLITRK2 on the X chromosome identified by exome sequencing in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. Functional studies showed that some variants displayed impaired membrane transport and impaired excitatory synapse-promoting effects. Strikingly, these variations abolished the ability of SLITRK2 wild-type to reduce the levels of the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB in neurons. Moreover, Slitrk2 conditional knockout mice exhibited impaired long-term memory and abnormal gait, recapitulating a subset of clinical features of patients with SLITRK2 variants. Furthermore, impaired excitatory synapse maintenance induced by hippocampal CA1-specific cKO of Slitrk2 caused abnormalities in spatial reference memory. Collectively, these data suggest that SLITRK2 is involved in X-linked neurodevelopmental disorders that are caused by perturbation of diverse facets of SLITRK2 function. The protein SLITRK2 plays an important role in synaptic communication.

Elucidating controllable factors associated with EV release in RBC products is thus important to better manage the quality and properties of RBC units. Erythrocyte-derived EVs (EEVs) and platelet-derived EVs (PEVs) were counted in 1226 RBC units (administered to 280 patients) using a standardized cytometry-based method. EV size and CD47 and annexin V expression were also measured. The effects of donor characteristics, processing methods, and storage duration on EV counts were analyzed by using standard comparison tests, and analysis of covariance was used to determine factors independently associated with EV counts. PEV as well as EEV counts were higher in whole-blood-filtered RBC units compared with RBC-filtered units; PEV counts were associated with filter type (higher with filters associated with higher residual platelets), and CD47 expression was higher on EEVs in RBC units stored longer. Multivariate analysis showed that EEV counts were strongly associated with filter type (P < .0001), preparation, and storage time (+25.4 EEV/mu L per day [P = .01] and +42.4 EEV/mu L per day [P < .0001], respectively). The only independent factor associated with PEV counts was the residual platelet count in the unit (+67.1 PEV/mu L; P < .0001). Overall, processing methods have an impact on EV counts and characteristics, leading to large variations in EV quantities transfused into patients. RBC unit processing methods might be standardized to control the EV content of RBC units if any impacts on patient outcomes can be confirmed. The IMIB (Impact of Microparticles in Blood) study is ancillary to the French ABLE (Age of Transfused Blood in Critically III Adults) trial (ISRCTN44878718).","[Gamonet, Clementine; Desmarets, Maxime; Mourey, Guillaume; Biichle, Sabeha; Aupet, Sophie; Saas, Philippe; Tiberghien, Pierre; Garnache-Ottou, Francine] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Unite Mixte Rech 1098, Ingn Cellulaire & Gen, Interact Hote Greffon Tumeur,INSERM,Etab Francais, 8 Rue Dr JFX Girod, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Desmarets, Maxime; Binda, Delphine; Vidal, Chrystelle] Ctr Hosp Univ CHU Besancon, Ctr Invest Clin 1431, INSERM, Besancon, France; [Mourey, Guillaume; Naegelen, Christian; Marpaux, Nadine; Delettre, Fanny Angelot; Morel, Pascal; Tiberghien, Pierre; Garnache-Ottou, Francine] Etab Francais Sang Bourgogne Franche Comte, Besancon, France; [Laheurte, Caroline] Etab Francais Sang Bourgogne Franche Comte, Plateforme BioMonitoring, Besancon, France; [Francois, Anne] Etab Francais Sang Ile France, Ivry, France; [Resch, Eric] Etab Hauts France, Lille, France; [Bigey, Frederic] Etab Francais Sang Grand Est, Strasbourg, France; [Bardiaux, Laurent] Etab Francais Sang Pyrenees Mediterranee, Toulouse, France; [Lacroix, Jacques] Univ Montreal, Dept Pediat, Serv Soins Intensifs Pediat, CHU St Justine, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Capellier, Gilles] Ctr Hosp Reg Univ Minjoz, Serv Reanimat, Besancon, France",,"Garnache-Ottou, F (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Unite Mixte Rech 1098, Ingn Cellulaire & Gen, Interact Hote Greffon Tumeur,INSERM,Etab Francais, 8 Rue Dr JFX Girod, F-25000 Besancon, France.",francine.garnache@efs.sante.fr,"Saas, Philippe/M-9605-2019; Garnache Ottou, Francine/ABE-2092-2021; Tiberghien, Pierre/AAH-5878-2019; MOREL, Pascal/ABE-1306-2021; Desmarets, Maxime/AAB-9897-2022","Saas, Philippe/0000-0002-8857-9939; Desmarets, Maxime/0000-0002-3801-5297; Laheurte, Caroline/0000-0002-1364-4556; DELETTRE, Fanny/0000-0003-0801-0986; Tiberghien, Pierre/0000-0002-9310-8322; BIGEY, Frederic/0000-0002-7424-429X; AUPET, Sophie/0000-0002-0858-2493; mourey, guillaume/0000-0002-9772-9898",Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique 2013 [PHRCN13299328N]; EFS National 2011 [2011-11],Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique 2013; EFS National 2011,"The authors thank all members of the preparation and distribution service of the EFS Bourgogne Franche-Comte, EFS Auvergne Rhone-Alpes, EFS Grand-Est, EFS Hauts de France/Normandie, EFS Occitanie Pyrenees/Mediterrannee, EFS Provence-Alpes Cote d'Azur/Corse, and EFS Ile de France, as well as F.

However, the mechanism by which the entry of blood cells into the valves affects the biology of aortic valvular interstitial cells (VICs) remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate the putative link between intraleaflet hematoma and aortic valve calcification and to assess its pathophysiological implications. METHODS The spatial relationship between calcium deposits and intraleaflet hematomas was analyzed by whole-mount staining of calcified and noncalcified human aortic valves, obtained in the context of heart transplantation and from patients who underwent surgical valve replacement. Endothelial microfissuring was evaluated by en face immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopic analyses of the fibrosa surface. Red blood cell (RBC) preparations were used in vitro to assess, by immunofluorescence microscopy and Alizarin red staining, the potential impact of intraleaflet hematomas on phenotypic changes in VICs. RESULTS Intraleaflet hematomas, revealed by iron deposits and RBCs into the fibrosa, secondary to endothelial microfissuring, were consistently found in noncalcified valves. The contact of primary VICs derived from these valves with RBCs resulted in a global inflammatory and osteoblastic phenotype, reflected by the up-regulation of interleukin-6, interleukin-1b, bone sialoprotein, osteoprotegerin, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B, bone morphogenic protein 2, and muscle segment homeobox 2, the production of osteocalcin, and the formation of calcium deposits. CONCLUSIONS The acquisition of an osteoblastic phenotype in VICs that come into contact with the senescent RBCs of intraleaflet hematomas may play a critical role in the initiation of calcium deposition into the fibrosa of human aortic valves.","[Morvan, Marion; Arangalage, Dimitri; Franck, Gregory; Perez, Fanny; Cattan-Levy, Lea; Jacob-Lenet, Marie-Paule; Deschildre, Catherine; Choqueux, Christine; Even, Guillaume; Michel, Jean-Baptiste; Messika-Zeitoun, David; Nicoletti, Antonino; Caligiuri, Giuseppina; Laschet, Jamila] Natl Inst Hlth & Med Res, U1148, Paris, France; [Arangalage, Dimitri; Cattan-Levy, Lea; Codogno, Isabelle; Messika-Zeitoun, David; Caligiuri, Giuseppina] Hop Xavier Bichat, Dept Cardiol, Paris, France; [Arangalage, Dimitri; Messika-Zeitoun, David; Nicoletti, Antonino; Laschet, Jamila] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Fac Med Paris Diderot, Paris, France; [Back, Magnus] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Stockholm, Sweden",,"Caligiuri, G; Laschet, J (corresponding author), Hop Xavier Bichat, INSERM, U1148, 46 Rue Henri Huchard, F-75018 Paris, France.",giuseppina.caligiuri@inserm.fr; jamila.laschet@inserm.fr,"Michel, Jean-Baptiste/AAH-9336-2020; Nicoletti, Antonino/A-9460-2015; Caligiuri, Giuseppina/G-4810-2015; Arangalage, Dimitri/AAJ-8160-2020","Nicoletti, Antonino/0000-0002-2623-0897; Caligiuri, Giuseppina/0000-0003-4973-2205; Arangalage, Dimitri/0000-0002-0898-9090; Laschet, Jamila/0000-0002-5090-4417","Fondation de France [FDF 2013 00038582]; French Government through the National Research Agency (ANR) Program Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-16-RHUS-0003_STOP-AS, ANR16-RHUS-00010_iVASC]; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris; Fondation Lefoulon-Delalande; European Union PRESTIGE program [2017-1-0032]; Federation Francaise de Cardiologie (FFC)",Fondation de France(Fondation de France); French Government through the National Research Agency (ANR) Program Investissements d'Avenir(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris; Fondation Lefoulon-Delalande; European Union PRESTIGE program; Federation Francaise de Cardiologie (FFC),"Drs.

Because the endogenous miR-155-5p has been ascribed to vasculoprotection, loading it onto positively charged, core-shell poly(isobutylcyanoacrylate) (PIBCA)-polysaccharide nanoparticles (NPs) was attempted. NPs showed a decrease (p < 0.0001) in surface electrical charge (zeta potential), with negligible changes in size or shape when loaded with the anionic miR-155-5p. Presence of miR-155-5p in loaded NPs was further quantified. Cytocompatibility up to 100 mu g/mL of NPs for 2 days with human coronary artery endothelial cells (hCAECs) was documented. NPs were able to enter hCAECs and were localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Expression of miR-155-5p was increased within the cells by 75-fold after 4 hours of incubation (p < 0.05) and was still noticeable at day 2. Differences between loaded NP-cultured cells and free miRNA, at days 1 (p < 0.05) and 2 (p < 0.001) suggest the ability of prolonged load release in physiological conditions. Expression of miR-155-5p downstream target BACH1 was decreased in the cells by 4-fold after 1 day of incubation (p < 0.05). This study is a first proof of concept that miR-155-5p can be loaded onto NPs and remain intact and biologically active in endothelial cells (ECs). These nanosystems could potentially increase an endogenous cytoprotective response and decrease damage within infarcted hearts.","[Antunes, Joana C.; Benarroch, Louise; Moraes, Fernanda C.; Juenet, Maya; Gross, Marie-Sylvie; Aubart, Melodie; Boileau, Catherine; Caligiuri, Giuseppina; Nicoletti, Antonin; Ollivier, Veronique; Chaubet, Frederic; Letourneur, Didier; Chauvierre, Cedric] Univ Paris 13, Univ Paris, LVTS, INSERM U1148, F-75018 Paris, France",,"Chauvierre, C (corresponding author), Univ Paris, LVTS, INSERM U1148, Cardiovasc Bioengn,X Bichat Hosp, Paris, France.",cedric.chauvierre@inserm.fr,"Antunes, Joana C./R-9445-2018; Ollivier, Véronique/AAA-2241-2022; Aubart, Mélodie/AHA-5006-2022; Chauvierre, Cédric/C-9084-2009; Caligiuri, Giuseppina/G-4810-2015; Chaubet, Frederic/L-4570-2017","Antunes, Joana C./0000-0003-2036-2730; Aubart, Mélodie/0000-0002-4383-7930; Chauvierre, Cédric/0000-0002-0937-4709; Caligiuri, Giuseppina/0000-0003-4973-2205; Custodio de Moraes, Fernanda/0000-0003-0259-7173; Chaubet, Frederic/0000-0001-7375-0425; Benarroch, Louise/0000-0003-2805-9170","European Union project NanoAthero [FP7-NMP-2012-LARGE-6-309820, ANR-13-LAB1-0005-01]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq) from Brazil [201245/2017-5]; NPs.
